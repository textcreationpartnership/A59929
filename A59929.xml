            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath all along ſeemed remarkable, that in the great Revolutions of Divine Providence, when great things have been drawing on to be acted for the good of Gods Church; though they have been foretold and promiſed, yet at the time of their accompliſhment, they have been uſually by many of God people little expected, if
<pb facs="tcp:102107:5"/>not gainſay'd, and oppoſed by moſt: When the 430. years pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding <hi>Iſraels</hi> return out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which God had foreſhewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were towards their expiration, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would not take notice that God would by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; and even when the time was almoſt fully come, that God ſhould deliver them out of that <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, ſo long as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was able to reſiſt, they were frequently out of heart, and complained againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and yet upon <hi>the ſelf ſame day,</hi> from the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein the ſaid 430. years were expired, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were actually delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. And after that, all the while they were in the Wilderneſs, how often, upon how many occaſions did the moſt of them turn back in their hearts (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh) into <hi>Egypt?</hi> and by their renewed rebellion ſo provoked God, that he ſware in his wrath againſt that generation, <hi>that they ſhould not enter into that reſt.</hi> Yea, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was ſo provoked by them, <hi>that he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips;</hi> and they ſo tempted <hi>Aaron</hi> the Saint of Lord, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.16. that neither of them came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor any other of the people, ſave <hi>Joſua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> of all that generation above the age of 20. years, that had been delivered out of the hands of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> yet in Gods own time he accompliſhed his promiſe in giving that people poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that land, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.14. When faithful and holy <hi>David</hi> was anointed to be the Captain of Gods people, even he in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords battels found the ſheild of his faith ſo ſhattered, that deſpondently once he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul;</hi> and thereupon ran himſelf upon dangerous rocks of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongſt Gods enemies, from which notwithſtanding God graciouſly delivered him, and at laſt brought him into full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Kingdom over all the tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> When <hi>Judahs</hi> 70. years Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> was almoſt expired, <hi>they deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, and ſay the time is not yet come to build the houſe of the Lord,</hi> Haggai 2.2. by whom God yet foreſhewed, that the great Mountain of ſtrong oppoſition, that ſtood before <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> ſhould become a plain, and ſo it came to paſs. Yea, when Chriſt himſelf, the long expected <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> came at the time, in the place, manner, condition, and in every reſpect, as had been foretold he ſhould come in the fleſh; how few, even in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or in <hi>Judaea,</hi> acknowledged or regarded his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful birth, his holy and wiſe demeavour, and heavenly manner of
<pb facs="tcp:102107:6"/>life; after all thoſe divine witneſſes of <hi>Simeon, Zachary, Anna, Elizabeth,</hi> &amp;c. or the very Angels before and at his birth, or any thing afterward that ſet him forth to be wonderful before the time came wherein he openly manifeſted himſelf in the world; and after that how was his perſon deſpiſed, his doctrine and miracles (though ſuch as never man taught or wrought in the world before) not only not regarded, but even blaſphemed by the great ones of thoſe times? and by their means likewiſe, not owned by inferiours, leſt they ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogue: and though ſome of the Preiſts believed in him, they durſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him. If <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Mr. in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> acknowledge and own him, it muſt be in the night, when he may not be ſeen; and all the ſtrange wonders before and at his death and reſurrection, and afterwards for the moſt part neglected and buried in ſilence: So ſtrangely in the worlds view, and even in good mens too many times, Gods greateſt predictions and promiſes uſe to take place. And have not ſince Chriſt, the ſix firſt Seals of the Primitive times (when <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon fought hand to hand, as 'twere, whoſe worſhip ſhould be ſet up) and ſome of the Trumpets after wards been myſtically ſulfilled and paſſed, according to the ſeries of their ſeveral times? which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> on the <hi>Revelations</hi> very appoſitly applies. How have thoſe many Synchroniſms of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts tyranny 42. <hi>months, with the two witneſſes propheſie in ſackcloth</hi> 1260. <hi>days of years,</hi> Rev. 11. <hi>The Beaſt out of the Sea, having ſeven heads and ten horns,</hi> according to his Politick capacity, <hi>the other out of the Earth, with two horns like a Lamb,</hi> according to the Eccleſiaſtical capacity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. lyen hidden from moſt mens eyes? And hath not the woman the true Church (though gloriouſly at firſt adorned <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.) yet ſince <hi>as long been forced into the wilderneſs, Rev.</hi> 14. <hi>where her place was prepared;</hi> and all that while the Scarlet Whore, the Antichriſtian or falſe Church, ſits as a Queen, and not only bewitcheth the Chriſtian World with her Sorceries, but alſo with the Cup of her Spiritual Fornications, makes drunk the Kings of the Earth, <hi>till the will of God ſhall be fulfilled, when they ſhall hate her, and make her deſolate, and naked, and eat her fieſh, and burn her with fire,</hi> Rev. 17.16, 17. And how few take notice that the time of her recompence is near? <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.6, 7. How many of Gods Vials are already poured out upon her? How far ſhe hath done her utmoſt in killing Chriſts witneſſes, even few do ſeriouſly ponder. And when the ſecond Woe is

<pb n="y" facs="tcp:102107:7"/>antient and latter Prophets as earneſtly called in for evidence hereunto, as we ſhall endeavour (by Gods aſſiſtance to point out afterward,) yet, ſo Providence hath over-ruled and ordered, that though the ſubſtance of all theſe things were antiently and all along promiſed to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and foretold by the holy Prophets ſucceſſively in all ages, and much by the Jews in our Saviours own time (though both unſeaſonably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitably) expected; and as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and others, from <hi>Juſtine Martyr,</hi> and other Ancients Teſtifie, how the things in the ſaid thouſand years were uſually by Chriſtians beleived in the times next after Chriſt; yet what by the ſubtilty of Satan teaching the Jews and others to affix ſuch vain fables, and ſenſual delights (ſomewhat like to a Mahumetan Paradiſe) to that time of Chriſts glorious Dominion in the world, that occaſioned many anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern worthies, (as may happily more hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) too much to have declined from truth to avoid ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed errors; And ſince by mens apprehenſions of inconſiſtency of thoſe things, with ſome Articles of Chriſtian faith, ſome have thereupon endeavoured (as may appear) to thruſt this thouſand years of Chriſts raign into ſuch troubleſome corners of times moving Tabernacle, where it never could long find that reſt and peace wherewith it muſt notwithſtanding in due time be bleſſed; And to give ſuch harſh and forced interpretations of many Propheſies, both in Old and New Teſtament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that happy time to come, as are unſuitable to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them. And an other ſtratagem of late times Satan hath uſed upon the breaking forth of ſome beams of light, again appearing, concerning that ſaid happy period to come, to ſtir up the owners of ſuch Doctrine to turn Libertines,
<note place="margin">Spoken according to the then preſent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I had tillfurther light (through grace) as after may appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerious view in the ſequel</note> from the bonds of moral obedience due unto Magiſtrates, as Chriſts deputies; yea, to attempt even to take away Magiſtracy it ſelf, and Miniſtry too; whereas Chriſts Saints muſt not take the Kingdom to themſelves, till he, the great King of Kings, give it to them in his own time, not in theirs (or elſe ſo perſonally to underſtand his raign in his humane nature upon earth, in a bodily preſence, that it may ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſome Articles of Chriſtian Religion, when ſacred truth allows not ſo to determine) or as others, by putting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable ſenſes upon the Divine Myſteries, not accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſcope of the Spirit of God therein obſervable; which
<pb n="y" facs="tcp:102107:7"/>Doctrine, when the Spirit of truth ſhall defecate and cleanſe from all old dreggs and ſcum of former and late errors, miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and miſtakes, I confidently believe for the ſubſtance, it will be owned as a precious truth among the beloved people of God (though we may not put weight upon the gronndleſs conceits or fancies of men) and the ſacredwritings both of Old and New Teſtament, may throughly evince it, but eſpecially this Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt will neceſſarily enforce it, if rightly and orderly conſidered, eſpecially compared with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Ezekiel,</hi> and other Prophets; My endeavour therefore ſhall be by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of grace and truth, who will lead his ſervants in due time, into all profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truth, to point out ſuch things tending hereunto (which my own infirmity may otherwiſe prejudice) unto others, which notwithſtanding, as I ſhall endeavour, I humbly requeſt may be done with prayers and faithful endeavours, by others better fitted for ſuch a work, all prejudices to the contrary being wholly laid aſide in conſidering the laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus Chriſt in the laſt branch of it, now upon proving; and therefore at ſuch a time men had need be wary they do not go about even then to diſallow and diſprove of it, when it is neer to be put in execution; eſpecially, ſince he upon earth gave this intimation to the world, to beware of infidelity upon this occaſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. as may appear from the former Chapter; <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Son of man ſhall come, ſhall he find faith upon earth?</hi> He knew well what wiles Satan would uſe to darken the knowledge of that time (which he the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murtherer of mankind, beleiving trembles at; as is conceived, was the mark ſet upon <hi>Cain,</hi> his firſt-born, murtherer of his Brother <hi>Abel</hi>) when he himſelf muſt be ſhut up in his dungeon of darkneſs, from ſeducing men, which will be his ſore tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all that time, and the fore-runner of his ſpeedily enſuing perpetual unexpreſſible miſery, and that upon his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the long promiſed and hoped for happy light and glory of Gods Church ſhall ariſe and ſhine forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.1. which will adde to his anguiſh; And as <hi>Cain</hi> built Cities for his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed poſterity, thereby to abate the ſence of his trembling; but the univerſal deluge both deſtroyed them and their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; ſo ever ſince mans fall, the Devil to abate the ſence of his own horrour, hath been building many Caſtles in the
<pb facs="tcp:102107:8"/>Aair, of wicked deſignes and ſeducements, but knows when Chriſts raign ſhall take place, they muſt all periſh with their Author; And therefore no wonder that Satan ſhould ſeek to conceal and hide that period from men, raging the more, becauſe he knows his time is ſo ſhort; Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rather, by faithful prayers, and diligent ſearch of holy Scriptures, commend our ſelves to the guidance of Gods holy Spirit, to be led into all truth, and particularly in what concern Chriſts Kingly rule on earth, not with reſpect unto what owning it hath by men, but as witneſſed unto by the Word of God, which is the ſaid holy Spirits evidence, which if he once appear to ſet his Seal unto, none ſhall make it void, but it ſhall powerfully overcome, and be victorious in the end, as all other witneſſings of Chriſt Jeſus have and do, and ſhall overcome the oppoſers of them, though never ſo great, many or eminent in the world.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:102107:8"/>And not having ſo fully diſcerned (then) the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a perſonal appearance above <hi>1000.</hi> years before (as ſince I beleive to be evident) as by the laſt Paper of the <gap reason="foreign">

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Confeſs, by reaſon of the ſtream of Interpreters running contrary, and the ſeeming diſagreement with ſome articles of Chriſtian faith, I have been apt to decline any opinion of Chriſts raigning with his Saints the thouſand years to come: But ſince Gods divine providence by his word and ſpirit, hath guided me into a more intenſe and ſerious conſideration of the great emergencies thereof towards his Church in theſe latter times; by whoſe eſpecial grace, upon ſearch into thoſe myſtical Propheſies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the <hi>Revelation,</hi> with other ſacred Scriptures, which doubtleſs hold out many things in reference thereunto; I have found much ſatisfaction in ſuch of Gods proceedings, and by the ſeries of times decyphered in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> I ſee there is a neceſſity of finding ſome way of reconciling or removing ſuch appearing difficulties or differences amongſt good men: For though ſome by interpreting the day of the Lord to be taken for the whole time of Chriſts raign upon earth; from his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to the end, complexively, in the ſence St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to ſpeak of, One day with the Lord is as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day, all which time they perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to be with his Church upon earth, in his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; againſt which I ſhall (by Gods aſſiſtance) offer ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be weighed in due place.

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shewing how according to the eternal decree, upon the fall of man, the Office of Mediatourſhip, was committed to the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, Jeſus Chriſt, the onely begotten Son of the ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, to be executed in his three great Offices of a Prophet, Prieſt, and King, not onely in reſpect of particular beleiving ſouls, but in a general conſideration more eminently, in reſpect of the three great periods of the World:</hi> 1. <hi>In his prophetical Office under the Old Teſtament, revealing by his Spirit, in his Meſſengers, all the counſel of his Father, concerning his Church.</hi> 2. <hi>In His Prieſtly Office under the New Teſtament; By offering himſelf an oblation for, and after by making interceſſion for the ſins of his people, at the right hand of God; And</hi> 3. <hi>will alſo execute his Kingly Office, delivering them from all their enemies, actually in this world, at his appearing, and in the thouſand years, unto the end of the world, and thenceforth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe firſt thing we named to be done,
<note place="margin">See the quotations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture added in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner.</note> was the laying down of thoſe <hi>Theſes</hi> or poſitions agreeing to the holy Scripture, and the Analogy of Faith, that may make way for Doctrines of this nature, which are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That as the infinite excellency of the nature and being of the <hi>Trin-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne Dietie,</hi> was everlaſtingly incomprehenſible in it ſelf, ſaving onely ſo far forth as the ſame Divine eſſence hath been pleaſed to communicate any diſcovery of it ſelf by word or works, or both, unto any creatures in Heaven or earth; ſo hath the Trinity of perſons in the Unity of the Divine eſſence, both in the eternal decrees, and in the execution of all joyntly in their order concurred, and ſo will do from eternity, through all times, unto all eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all the glory of God the Father, was by the eternal decree to be manifeſt in Jeſus Chriſt his onely begotten Son, the Lamb ſlain in the eternal decree of the Father, before the foundation of the World was ſaid; and according to the ſaid eternal decree, the Holy Ghoſt, one God co-eſſential, and co-equal with the Father, and the Son, proceeds from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, the Mediatour between God and man, as the ſole efficacious worker and accompliſher of all ſpiritual
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102107:11"/>good, in and for Men and Angels, and all real good in all creatures, which in their ſeveral orders and natures they were capable of receiving.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Accordingly in the creation God made the world by his wiſdom, the eternal word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. The Spirit ſitting, as it were upon the ſurface of the waters, then covering the earth powerfully to produce the creatures, then to be made, and ſo both the Heavens with the Angels (as Divines conceive) and the earth were made the firſt day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. as all that were made in the whole world, afterward in the five following days, which the word <hi>Elohim</hi> in the Plural number, put with the Verb <hi>Barah</hi> in the ſingular number, denoting the Trinity of perſons in the unity of eſſence ſeems to declare, whoſe concurrence in the making of man is likewiſe very remarkably expreſt, when God ſaid, <hi>Let us make man in our own image, after our likeneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 1.26.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The making of Angels in Heaven, and man and all creatures in the world, was in the execution of the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the ſaid incomprehenfibly glorious <hi>Trin-une Diety,</hi> in their ſeveral orders, natures, ſtations, and conditions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As no other but the holy and good will and pleaſure of the infinitely, glorious, &amp; incomprehenſible God was the reaſon and cauſe why they were all made abſolutely as they were; ſo that they ſhould be for himſelf (as his word witneſſeth) as their utmoſt end, and no other inconſiſtent reaſons or ends ought to be given or aſſigned by men.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, As the whole creation was all good, ſuitable to the Author of it; ſo the preſerving, ordering, over-ruling and diſpoſing of all creatures according to his good pleaſure, by his infinite wiſdom, power, providence, and goodneſs, is not to be meaſured or judged by any ſcantling of any created capacity, who will notwithſtanding be juſtified in his ſaying, and clear when he is judged; there being in ſuch his proceedings, ſo many fathomleſs depths in reſpect of creatures, which it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any men to ſearch into, further then Gods word doth warrant them, but in things not revealed or forbidden they are not to enquire.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Since God according to his ſaid eternal decree, and good pleaſure of his will at the fall of our firſt parents in Paradiſe, revealed and teſtified his wonderful power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful grace; That the bleſſed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed of the woman ſhould break the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102107:11"/>ſerpents head, there is ſufficient ground for ever to humble all mankind, and for ever to exalt Gods free and rich grace therein, and all men are thereby engaged to uſe all Gods means to obtain their part therein.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, According to the declaration of that wonderful rich and free grace of God, for the ſalvation of his people, and for carrying on of his great deſign therein, as the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, by an eternal decree, had purpoſed ſo to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully glorified in the powerful redemption and ſalvation of his elect people, in ſuch a way of free grace; So in the creation of all things, all ſorts of creatures were made in a capacity to carry on that deſign, and from that very period of their firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, holily, &amp; moſt wiſely over-ruled and diſpoſed of, in reference thereunto, and ſo ever ſince have been, are and ſhall be moſt wonderfully holily and powerfully (though many times ſecretly and unſearchably) throughout all ages, by the joynt concurrence of all the ſaid three perſons of the moſt ſacred Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity, in their order of working, to the infallible perfecting and compleating of the ſaid deſign decree, and purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, That the management and adminiſtration of the great work of Mediatorſhip, between God and man, ever ſince the ſaid promiſed ſeed was revealed to our firſt Parents, hath been committed to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, who in his Word commands all men to hear him; by acknowledging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and obeying him.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, that the management and adminiſtration of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between God and Man, hath ever ſince been executed by Chriſt in his three great Offices, wherein he and he onely is to appear moſt powerful, wonderful, gracious, and glorious to his Church upon earth, as her great Prophet, Prieſt, and King.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Chriſts execution of the ſaid three great Offices, is two ways to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. More generaly for his univerſal Church, in reſpect of the ſeveral ſeaſons, wherein in order he was to execute them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, moſt eminently, until his work of Mediatorſhip ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly be accompliſhed, and full reconciliation made between God and all his elect people; his myſtical body, the true Church, being compleat in all the members of it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect union and communion attained with himſelf, as their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical head; together with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, as alſo with the glorious Angels, and one with another, in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102107:12"/>moſt happy enjoyment of all good, to all eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is again conſiderable, particularly and ſpecially, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of every truely beleiving ſoul, in the particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the efficacy of thoſe three great Offices to them, by his holy Spirit, making good means and ordinances effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acious to every faithful ſoul, ſo exhibiting himſelf to them, 1. As their great Prophet inwardly, powerfully, and ſavingly, teaching them all neceſſary truth and doctrine; 2. As their great High-Prieſt, in the like way evidencing their peace and reconciliation with God, through that expiation he ſhould or hath made for their ſins. 3. In the like-way alſo to evidence to them at one time or other, that he is their powerful King and Protector, that hath, and doth, and will ſubdue all his and their enemies, and keep them in a loyal and good condition by Faith and Grace unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Conſider that the general, more eminent and glorious execution of thoſe three great offices for his univerſal Church more remarkeable in the world, is in thoſe three great periods of his manifeſting himſelf in the world, according to all that his father had given him to do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the great Prophet of his Church, by his ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation, in all his immediate Meſſengers, till his coming in the fleſh, and ſo Chriſt is ſaid to preach in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> to the Spirits in priſon, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the great High-Prieſt, in the ſecond Period after his coming in the fleſh, where putting an end to all the types and ſhadows of his Prieſthood, he actually undertook in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and executed the work and office of Prieſthood, as the great High-Prieſt, having made a full and perfect attonement, and ſatisfaction for the ſins of all his people, he aſcended into the holy of holies, the higheſt Heavens, there ſitting at the right hand of God the Father, powerfully and gloriouſly there to execute and improve that office, by making interceſſion for his people till his coming again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the third great period of the world, under or after the ſeventh Trumpet, Chriſt will appear moſt eminently in executing the great office of a King, in this general confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reſpect of his univerſal Church, ſubduing wonderfully and manifeſtly in the world, his own and his Churches enemies, powerfully and graciouſly enabling his Saints to walk in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102107:12"/>of his laws, taking away in a great degree the evil of ſin and ſuffering, with the cauſes of both, by binding Satan, and deſtroying the wicked powers of the world, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſay in a great degree, though not then totally nor finally.</p>
            <p>Laſtly Conſider, how Chriſt hath, and doth, and will work in theſe three great Periods of the world.</p>
            <p>In the firſt he wrought by his Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making known the Will of the Father in all things (for ſubſtance) reſpecting Faith and Obedience.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond, by his Spirit of grace and truth, powerfully ſanctifying his people more eminently and largely then in the former.</p>
            <p>In the laſt, when he will take to himſelf his Kingly power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <hi>and</hi> 19. <hi>He will work by his Spirit of Power and Domination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from the former Theſes duly weighed and conſidered, theſe particulars enſuing, or the like, may be inferred, <hi>viz.</hi> That</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the deſign of the Trin-Une Diety was to be eminently glorified in Chriſt the Mediator his three great Offices, of being the great Prophet, Prieſt and King of his univerſal true Church: then that greateſt glory muſt needs ſhine forth in the moſt eminent way of executing of them:</p>
            <p>But the general performance thereof, in the ſaid three great periods, is the moſt eminent way of executing them:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> That deſign hath and will be therein moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the drift and end of the great works of Creation, Support and Providence in all things, ever ſince time was, and until time ſhall ceaſe to be, was in reference unto Gods glorifying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſuch general management of theſe Offices of Chriſt, for his univerſal true Church, then in that reſpect he is moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
            <p>But their drift and end is ſo in reference thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> God is moſt glorified in ſuch management of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If ſuch general execution of them in reference to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal true Church, be the foundation and ſecuring thereof to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular beleiving ſouls; or ſecondly in reſpect of any more ſpecial times or ſpecial conditions of the Church as will hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; then all the good of the other is procured and ſecured by that general execution of them.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102107:13"/>
            <p>But ſuch Chriſts general execution of theſe Offices it he ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ſecuring of both the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> The good of both the other is ſecured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured thereby.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the great works of Creation, Support and Providence have been all along ordered in reference to Chrifts carrying on of his great work of Mediatorſhip, cheifly in thoſe three great periods forenamed; then ſuch conſideration of them is of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the true univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>But all thoſe ſaid great works have been ordered all along in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence to Chriſts carrying on his great work of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip therein.</p>

               <p>IT will not here be needful to multiply Texts of Scripture to confirm the former Theſes or Poſitions (for the main ſubſtance of them) which in moſt Syſtems of Divinity is already done to my hand: Onely I ſhall endeavour in that which may haply ſeem more unuſual, by the aſſiſtance of Chriſts Spirit and word remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>The teſtimony of Jeſus, which is the ſpirit of Propheſie,</hi> and that (remarkably I ſay) in divers reſpects,</p>

               <p>The Viſion <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. ſeem ſomewhat to be of a like nature to theſe, though not ſo large and full, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaw a great cloud, with whirlwinds and fire, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he had the deſcription of the four living Creatures, by theirfaces, feet, wings, with their joyning by their wings, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, to 12. then their proceeding, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 14. afterward the wheels that moved with the living creatures, and wheels within wheels, from verf. 14 to verſ. 26. where there is ſomewhat a like repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſacred Trinity of perſons, to the end of the Chapter, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. and more explicitly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. it is ſaid one of the Seraphims cried one to another, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hoſts, the whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> In both which Viſions whether the four living creatures in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> were Angels, or as they are called in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.

               </p>
               <p>So the true inviſible Church of God here ſet forth, by her conſtant repreſentatives, the four living wights, and twenty four Elders, is a Throne of God upon Earth, where his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencie is diſcovered as Creatour, three in Perſons, one in Eſſence, according to the Miniſtration of the Old Teſtament, in which the Rain-bow minding men of the Son the ſecond perſon, ſhews Gods juſtice in deſtroying the Old World in their height of ſin, and mercy to thoſe in his Ark, the Church, at preſent clean or unclean creatures, and ſo for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or reſervation, at leaſt of thoſe ever ſince in the New-World.</p>
               <p>The four living wights were in the midſt, and round about the Throne, as in the midſt of each ſquare of the Throne, and had each eyes before and behind, to look to God to have the knowledge of himſelf and his will in every quarter, and to look to the people on every part, how they might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably inform them, and guide them in all the will and ways of God; <hi>They reſt not day nor night, ſaying, Holy, Holy, Holy, &amp;c.</hi> They as Gods watchmen attend upon that, to diſcern for, and diſcover unto his people the Will of God. For the Lord would do nothing but he revealed it unto his Servants the Prophets;

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102107:15"/>and when voyces of joy, &amp;c. whence matter of praiſe and glory to be rendered to him that ſits upon the throne.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs, if we look upon this Chapter in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, of the viſional repreſentations and Doctrine, and Uſe thereof, we may diſcern an excellent abridgement of the old Teſtament diſcoveries, ſet forth to us (not that the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament differs in ſubſtance from the New, but only in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the accompliſhment of the main thing therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, <hi>viz.</hi> The coming of the Meſſiah in the fleſh, for the finiſhing of the work which his father had given him for to do) there is the Doctrine of the Sacred Trinity, both decyphered and taught (as was noted before) God is explicitely prayſed there as Creatour. That man had fallen is ſignified by the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, ſignifying his mercy and judgement; Judgement to the Old world after his long Patience exerciſed towards them, and abuſed by them; mercytowards <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, and thoſe with him there, with ſecurity of preſervation, or reſervation at leaſt to the New world, from drowning any more by a general deluge.</p>
               <p>That ſin was then grown to an height, it muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when God in ſuch wrath drowned a world of men and creatures with them; and that ſin and diſorders were long in the world before they came to that height, and yet it was not deſtroyed, until about 1656. years after God had created it; which likewiſe ſhews God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, who created it, had a way of redemption for ſuch as <hi>Noah,</hi> (elſe in juſtice it muſt have immediately periſhed) as well as long exerciſed patience towards them in the old World, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation for thoſe of the New world, from alike flood; And this redemption and ſalvation was almoſt as ſoon publiſhed by God himſelf, as ſin had entered into the world, to deface and diſorder Gods good work of creation, which Salvation was to come by the bleſſed ſeed of the woman, then diſcovered, which ſhould break the Serpents head; And no ſooner were all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders convented at the fall, before their great Judge in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and arraigned, and tryed, and ſentenced; but this light of divine grace, according to the decree of the holy and bleſſed Trinity, which had before in a joynt concurrence created the world, breaketh forth, again to enlighten the world, newly darkened by ſin and death, and God himſelf ſo ſhews himſelf in his way of grace, that he hid the ſhame, and covers the ſin,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102107:16"/>of his now new made, and newly loſt creatures that he maketh garments of skins of Beaſts to cover them, and even of ſuch creatures as thereby might ſhew to our firſt parents, that they had deſerved death, as thoſe Beaſts did whoſe skins did cover them, but likewiſe the death of ſuch beaſts as uſually ſhould be for ſacrifice, might ſignifie unto them, that they had ſuch a Saviour to dye for them, and by dying ſhould deliver them from the jaws of the ſecond death, by a more perfect ſacrifice, which thoſe beaſts did but typifie, and ſacramentally ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, by whoſe moſt precious robes of righteouſneſs, put upon them by God himſelf, they ſhould be clothed both to hide their nakedneſs and ſhame, and beautifully to adorn them in his ſight, as he then cloathed them with the skins of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent beaſts, <hi>viz.</hi> with the righteouſneſs of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that promiſed ſeed of the woman, (whence I conceive may be a good argument, for the ſalvation of both our firſt Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and that then God did not ſorſake them, the work of his own hands, as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 138.8. in that he himſelf ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their nakedneſs, and cloathed them with thoſe skins) (though their firſt born <hi>Cain</hi> periſhed with his wicked off-ſpring, for the moſt part, at leaſt afterwards by the flood) After this, as Chriſt by ſacrifices, and other inſtitutions of God, was from time to time ſet forth to his people, by the teachings of his holy ſpirit, ſo God the Creatour made known his glory in his Throne, the Church on earth, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was to come (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6) by the workings of the Holy Ghoſt, in all ſucceſſions of ages to the coming of Chriſt himſelf actually in the fleſh; Still from the Throne to the four living wights, and by them to his twenty four Elders, in all times hath he ſo in ſucceſſion diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf; of which diſcoveries we may obſerve two great Periods under the Old Teſtament (beſides many other leſſer ones) the two great Periods were the Old world before the Flood, and the new world after the flood, until Chriſts time, and theſe two, the Rainbow as we noted, evidently implies, in drowning the old world, and aſſuring preſervation to the new world from the like. In the firſt period, when God did communicate his pleaſure to any living wights, then neer to his Throne, it was not by written word, but by voyce, or viſion, or dreams, or any ways, he was then pleaſed to uſe to any ſorts of perſons, either extraordinarily inſpired, or to the fathers of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102107:16"/>Families, or the firſt born (as ſometimes he uſed) or ſuch as were eminently raiſed up by him, as <hi>Enoch, Noah, &amp;c.</hi> In regard they lived many hundreds of years, they might well by tradition and verbal inſtruction, perſonally teach the will and pleaſure of God to his people, and then they needed not the uſe of writing (ſo God moſt wiſely orders all things in their due ſeaſons) and indeed if they had had the gift of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it would have been in a manner endleſs, by reaſon of their long lives, and great knowledge, more then in <hi>Solomon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now as <hi>Moſes,</hi> the great Prophet, who by Gods direction firſt made that Ark, foretold of Chriſt, the great Prophet of his Church, that him the Lord their God would raiſe, like unto himſelf, and that he ſhould be heard in all things that he ſaid unto them, and as the Father required at his transfiguration, that they ſhould hear him, <hi>Math.</hi> 17. whoſe ſpirit both informed <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets, ſo by himſelf he was excellently, and immediately inſtructed in making of the Ark, and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and all that belonged to them, that all ſhould be made according to the pattern in the Mount; As <hi>Moſes</hi> was the inſtrumental deliverer of <hi>Abrahams, Iſaac's,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> natural poſterity, out of the boudage of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo the ſpiritual gifts and graces of Chriſt, unto the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> are the onely inſtruments of their ſpiritual deliverance from the ſpiritual bondage of ſin and Satan, when they are conveyed thereby (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were) through the Red Sea of Chriſts blood, and ſpiritually baptized by him (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) in the Cloud, and in the Sea of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Regeneration, and as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were circumciſed, when they had paſſed through the Red Sea, the badge of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Fathers, ſo the ſpiritual circumciſion was to be on the hearts of the ſpiritual ſeed, and as <hi>Moſes</hi> that was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Circumciſion, and the Law, could not bring the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> but <hi>Joſhua,</hi> accompanied with faithful <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi> did; So the Law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. and even ſo all the typical Prieſthood, and Sacrifices, and oblations, did but ſeem to ſet forth to the faith of Gods people, what was to be done by the true High-Prieſt, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his once offering up of himſelf for mans ſin in the end of the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>So here likewiſe by <hi>Davids</hi> providing for the building of Gods houſe, where the Ark ſhould reſt, as he intended, yet was not permitted, but it was promiſed to him, and fulfilled, when the Ark was gloriouſly placed there in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, and honoured by evident manifeſtations of Gods preſence there, (though all the inſtitutions then uſed in that Temple, which was a type of Chriſts body, were but likewiſe typical of his prieſtly Office, to come under the New Teſtament) ſo theſe two
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102107:18"/>famous Kings were eminently types of Chriſts Kingly Office.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As <hi>Sauls</hi> worldly Kingdom was to be removed to make way for <hi>Davids,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, who was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed of God, though ſometimes deſpiſed of men; and as <hi>David</hi> overcame all the enemies of Gods people; as <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom was full of troubles at firſt, yet after he had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat conqueſt over all his enemies round about, and enjoyed peace on every ſide; So Chriſt came in a low appearance into the world, (at leaſt in the worlds eye) yet by humbling himſelf, he got the victory; he hath been long fighting myſtically for his people, and ſhall at laſt gain them a peaceable Kingdom, and all his foes be made his footſtool in Gods due time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. but till that full victory, his Ark, as in <hi>Davids</hi> time, will be in a moving Tabernacle, but when the raign of the true <hi>Solomon</hi> comes, his Ark will be ſetled, his Kingdom ſhall be peaceable and flouriſhing; Now that theſe were but types of Chriſts Kingdom, appears by the eclypſing the glory of both; Firſt, after <hi>Davids</hi> victory he fell, and upon that ſucceeded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions from his own houſe to the end of his days; The moſt glorious raign of <hi>Solomon</hi> at firſt, afterwards ended in as dark obſcurity by ſin and ſufferings, and his Son <hi>Reboboam,</hi> groſly provoked <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the loſs of ten Tribes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> were in a declining condition, till that whole generation went into Captivity, and the Ark of God ceaſed to be any more with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeventy years, according to Gods promiſe, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were brought back to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by the decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as God foretold, yet the Ark of God was no more amongſt them, nor they ever after but in a decaying ſtate, though God upheld the race of <hi>David,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet much in obſcurity till Chriſt, that lineally was to proceed out of <hi>Davids</hi> loins, came in the fleſh; in whom that promiſe was ſo fulfilled (but yet in the ſet time when the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah</hi>) ſo that the glory of <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom was not to be in himſelf, or <hi>Solomon,</hi> or their poſterities, according to the fleſh only, but in Chriſt the great deliverer of his people, both from ſpiritual and temporal bondage and captivity (as the Prophets of old abundantly witneſs, and the New Teſtament confirms, as may be ſhewed hereafter, by Gods aſſiſtance) yea, <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in many Propheſies, foretells of Chriſts Kingdom, what never was, or can be performed, to his meer natural off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
<pb facs="tcp:102107:18"/>as beſides many others, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 72. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 137. do plainly ſhew.</p>
               <p>Again, Conſider that when ſome of the Jews came back from <hi>Babylon,</hi> what numerous multitudes (not many ages after) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Dominion, in <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> and Queen <hi>Heſters</hi> times, ſcattered (as <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid) through all the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty and ſeven Provinces that he ruled over, toward whom, as God ſhewed mercy to them, by <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> Marriage with <hi>Heſter,</hi> a captive Maid of the Jews, ſo thereby ſeems to be ſhadowed, how Chriſt the great King of his people, though they have been long ſcattered in the captivities of many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, yet will again betroth them unto him in faithfulneſs, as he ſpeaketh by the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. which flouriſhing time of Chriſts Kingdom, is deſcribed by the Spirit of God, in the thouſand years under or after the ſeventh Trumpet, of which many things will be revealed, when he ſhall take to himſelf his great power and raign, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and the Kingdoms of the world ſhall become the Kingdoms of our God, and of his Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. then as he the Angel of the Covenant, ſhews that at the beginning of the ſeventh Trumpet, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed; Chriſt had wrought myſtically in his Kingdom before, but then he will ſhew himſelf in his Kingly authority; before, the Ark in the Temple might not be ſeen, ſave by the High-Prieſt, but then the Temple in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall be opened, and there ſhall be ſeen in his Temple the Ark of his Teſtament, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.19. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were of old a generation of Prophets as <hi>David</hi> ſtiles them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 105.15. <hi>And do my Prophets no harm;</hi> for they had ſuch diſcoveries of God and his works renewed unto them by the Spirit of Chriſt in the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his five Books, wherein they were taught of the creation of all things, the deſtruction of the old world, the fall of man, the way of ſalvation for old and new world, what God had done for them, what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience he required of them, in what way, and by what ordinances they ſhould be accepted of him, which no other people had beſides them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yea, they were alſo a Generation of Prieſts then, for though onely the Prieſts in office, then in reference to Chriſt, might kill the Saerifices, and place them upon the Altar, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they were to bring their own Sacrifices to lay their hand

                  </gap>ſtifie their faith, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſins, to teſtifie their repentance, yet it was onely the faith and repentance of the true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that through Chriſt (unto whom they looked ſpiritually) by whoſe onely propitiation and attonement, they expected to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo ſpiritually now; Chriſt hath made all his ſervants in his true Church, both the twenty four Elders, and the four living wights, Kings and Prieſts unto God, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Kingdom by faith and grace they know they ſhall even upon earth injoy in due time, as may appear in the next <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>We ſhall reign upon earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we have repreſented what is here ſaid of Gods true Church, under the Old Teſtament, by the repreſentatives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, praiſing him as Creatour, all which time it is to be obſerved that his holy Sabbath was kept in remembrance of God, as creatour of Heaven and Earth, and that he reſted on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day from his work of Creation, which was by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the New Teſtament, changed to the firſt day of the week, in remembrance of the work of our Redemption, and for the honour of him our Redeemer, who roſe the firſt day of the week from the dead, when he had finiſhed that moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A few things more I ſhall commend to your Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration from the Old Teſtament, before we come to ſpeak of the fifth <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (as to our forementioned purpoſe) for whereas in the Viſion concerning the Trinity of perſons in the former <hi>Chap.</hi> the ſecond perſon <hi>viz.</hi> God the Son, to whom the great work of Mediatorſhip was committed, being ſet forth as it ſeems by the Rainbow, in ſight like an Emerald; which Rainbow plainly minds us both of the Flood and the Ark; the Flood again holding out,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Judgement to the Old World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mercy to <hi>Noah</hi> and the new World.</p>
               <p>Again, the Ark both then and from <hi>Moſes</hi> time, evidencing Chriſts gracious preſence with his people, both in the Old and New world; And the conſideration of God the Sons execution of all the Mediatours great Offices, as the great Prophet, Prieſt, and King of his true Church, are ſo frequently ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods people in ſucceſſion of times in the Church, as the great thing to be eyed by them, therefore beſides the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſpect of theſe three offices to the univerſal Church, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102107:19"/>the particular to every true beleiver in all times, there ſeems a third reſpect to be much taken notice of in Holy Scripture, of many ſpecial manifeſtations of the ſaid three Offices of Chriſt, in the ſeveral ages and conditions of his Church, or rather of Chriſts, ſo ſetting himſelf forth before his people, in thoſe ſeveral times in theſe three great Offices.</p>
               <p>For as there hath been a moſt large time of his Prophetical Office under the Old Teſtament, when Chriſt by a ſpirit of Wiſdom and Revelation, till his coming in the fleſh, revealed all his Fathers will.</p>
               <p>And 2. According to his Prieſty Office ever ſince; And ſo,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Will do in the third period, under or after the ſeventh Trumpet in his Kingly office, likewiſe, as may happily be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſervable in Scripture, how by a remarkable divine hand, there have been many ſhews hereof in many leſſer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Even before the flood, there were ſome ſhadowings of Chriſt in all his offices;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Propheſie, in that he revealed himſelf to the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the firſt times, by voyces, viſions, dreams, and the like, what ſervices would be acceptable to the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a Prieſt, in <hi>Enoch;</hi> in that <hi>Enoch,</hi> as Chriſt in the fleſh, came to do the Will of God in the body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.10. Who as Chriſts type, ſo walked with God, he was tranſlated; as Chriſt when he had done his Fathers Will, aſcended into Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As a King, in <hi>Noah,</hi> whom he fitted and inabled him ſo to preſerve his Family, and all them with him in the Ark, when all his enemies were wonderfully, and juſtly deſtroyed by the Flood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Again, after the Flood in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, Chriſt revealed his Fathers will to him, as his Prophet, calling him from his Fathers Idolatry, teaching him to ſerve the true God, as was agreeing to his will; making him a King by ſubduing thoſe Kings that had carried <hi>Lot</hi> captive, and reſcuing him, and thoſe that belonged to <hi>Lot;</hi> yea, in that he offered his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he acted as a Prieſt, and was bleſſed by <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> the Prieſt of the moſt high God, who was likewiſe King of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> of whoſe order of Prieſthood Chriſt was to be, who was without Father, without Mother, without beginning of days, or end of life, as the Apoſtle deſcribes him, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 7.3.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102107:20"/>
               <p>But Thirdly, more remarkably, after God would have an inſtituted Church in the poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to whom he had made and renewed his promiſe of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and given them the Sacrament of Circumciſion, as a ſign and ſeal of his free grace promiſed to them, and had brought their poſterity out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with an high hand, and conducted them through the Red Sea, to ſacrifice to himſelf in the wilderneſs, not as their Fathers had done formerly, but as <hi>Moſes</hi> told <hi>Pharoah, as the Lord their God ſhould afterwards teach them,</hi> for they knew not how he would be ſerved, till they came into the Wilderneſs, where he afterward appointed his inſtituted worſhip, for till the making of that Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, the Sacrifices that had been uſed all along, till then, ſeemed as much to have had the nature of a Sacrament, to ſtrengthen and confirm the faith of the belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Antients in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, (for we read not of any other they had, till <hi>Abraham</hi>) as to typifie unto them, that Chriſt was to dye for their ſins. But after Gods inſtituted Worſhip by <hi>Moſes</hi> Miniſtry, the ſaid three great Offices of Chriſt ſeem to be frequently ſhadowed out; <hi>Moſes</hi> was his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who is likewiſe ſaid to be King in <hi>Jeſurun;</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was his mouth unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at firſt, was afterwards actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the High-Prieſt, the firſt type of Chriſt, in that order and office; but all along that Miniſtration, till <hi>Sauls</hi> worldly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was ſet up in cauſeleſs diſcontent, by the peoples corrupt will, who would have a King (inſtead of good <hi>Samuel,</hi> and of God himſelf) who told <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.</note> they had not caſt off him, but God likewiſe; for they ſought a King after their own corrupt will, not ſeeking to know Gods pleaſure therein; which ſoon again fell, when God had ſought him a man, even <hi>David,</hi> whom God ſet up. And when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were actually come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had miraculouſly paſſed through the Red Sea (whereby was figured, how by Baptiſm, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Regeneration, Gods people are brought out of the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin and Satan, and ſo ſoon as they were come into the Wilderneſs (which many ways ſhadows out the ſtate of Gods people in the world, &amp;c.) then <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Prophet, makes known the Will of God to them; <hi>Aaron</hi> as a Prieſt makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to God for them, and Chriſt himſelf (as judicious <hi>Burgeſs</hi> proves) as the great King gives his Laws in great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and terrour, for all things to be obſerved by his people,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102107:20"/>though <hi>Moſes</hi> was then likewiſe his Deputy King in <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> and ſo all along in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Moſes</hi> was King and Prophet, and <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons Prieſts; So after that, when they were to paſs over <hi>Jordan,</hi> to enter into the promiſed Land, <hi>Joſhua</hi> is then made Captain, to fight Chriſts Battels, under that great King, that appeared to him, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 5. the Prieſts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Ark dry-ſhod, through the then overflowing waters of <hi>Jordan;</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> again, as a Prophet, reveals the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God unto them, not onely in civil affairs, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Again, many times in the Judges days, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua's</hi> counſels were forgot, and their predictions concerning that peoples revoltings were fulfilled; yet even then, Chriſt who was from the beginning the powerful great King of his Church, ruled many times amongſt them and their enemies too, apparently, as the Scriptures witneſs, even then likewiſe he raiſed up his Deputies, called Judges, as <hi>Gedeon, Jeptha, Deborah, Barack, Sampſon,</hi> and others, again to reſtore his inſtituted worſhip, and Prieſthood, and be deliverers to his revolted and oppreſſed people, as occaſion did require, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them by his prophetical ſpirit therein. But from the beginning of <hi>Davids</hi> time, as we noted theſe three great Offices were more remarkably, and eminently ſet forth, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially while things continued in any tolerable order, in the good Kings raigns that followed, wherein the glory of Chriſt the Mediator, in his three ſaid Offices, as Prophet, Prieſt, and King, was ſtill ſet forth in their following times, to ſhew that therein conſiſted the glory of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, as much more might be obſerved in this kind.</p>

For as we noted before in all the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> where things are not ſaid to ſucceed one another, as the Seals, Trumpets, and Viols, but one Table of Chronology is aſſigned to them all ſuch diſtinct Viſions are contemporaries (as all that concerned the true and falſe Church in Antichriſts time) have the ſame meaſure, though diverſly computed, by moneths, days, <hi>a time, times, and half.</hi> So all theſe Viſions, under, or rather after the ſeventh Trumpet, have one Chronogical Table to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their time, <hi>viz.</hi> a thouſand years, all which particulars being by Chriſts ſpecial order ſo ſtrongly aſſerted by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and the antient and latter Prophets, as earneſtly called in for evidence hereunto, for the ſtabliſhment of the Faith of Gods people herein, ſince he, the Lamb, that had power to reveal them to his beloved Diſciple Saint <hi>John,</hi> hath likewiſe power to execute and fulfil them in their ſeaſons, till all be done which in his Office of Mediatorſhip is committed to him, <hi>having therefore ſeven horns, and ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God, ſent forth into all the earth,</hi> whereby with his perfect
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102107:24"/>wiſdom and providence, he will accompliſh all that his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
               <p>Which Synchroniſmes in the laſt Period, according to Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> (in his <hi>Clavis Apocalyptiea</hi>) are as a guiding thread which who ſo taketh, and humbly and faithfully uſeth, may greatly (through grace) be helped in paſſing through many (otherwiſe inextricable labyrinths) in many dark paſſages of this book; for in this laſt period, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath gone contrary to the ſtream of Expoſituours, for many hundreds of years (as others ſince him have done) wherein for the ſubſtance there ſeems to be much clearneſs, (though the myſteries therein compriſed are very high and intricate) which in the enſuing, and now neer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching times, will doubtleſs be much unfolded, when the <hi>myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed,</hi> at the beginning of the ſounding of the ſeventh Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.7. and when likewiſe <hi>Gods Temple ſhall be opened in Heaven, and there ſhall be ſeen in his Temple, the Ark of his Teſtament,</hi> Chap. 11.19.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing in regard of all Chriſts other actings paſt ſince his taking of the book of <hi>Revelation</hi> at his Fathers hand, they have been myſtically and ſpiritually executed (though all moſt real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully) ſo I conceive the myſtical manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding his reign on earth, the thouſand years,

               <p>Now that this may appear more evident, let us diligently weigh and conſider what the repreſentative true Church do in the ſequel, who in the unity of Faith and ſpiritual Grace, through all the times contained in this book, looking in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſcovery or viſion, through all the ſeries of them, to the utmoſt compleating of the Lambs victory over Antichriſt and his followers, in that excellent Period of his Kingly power, ſolely and for ever, thence-forward to be held in his own hand, and <hi>We</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſhall reign upon earth,</hi> as may appear from the 8. <hi>verſe</hi> of this 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the end.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102107:26"/>to lye) which we ſhall endeavour to hold out two ways.
<note place="margin">Theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were writ the contrary way in the Original Copy.</note>

            <p>And Secondly, To ſhew that it probably may be underſtood in a myſtical manner, (for that ſome way it ſhall be according to Scripture is not to be denyed) <hi>but becauſe that ſuch as his raign ſhall be, ſuch will his coming be,</hi> when he is to raign, and take the Kingdom to himſelf, and ſet it up in the world; we ſhall therefore in reference thereunto (by Gods aſſiſtance) ſhew the ſeveral ſences of his coming, according to Scripture, ſince his Aſcention into Heaven, and endeavour to open this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſenſe of his coming to raign under or after the ſeventh Trumpet, and to give ſome illuſtrations thereof.</p>

And afterward appearing unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> with a Sword in his hand, he declared to him, he would go with him to ſubdue the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> ſaying, he himſelf was the Prince of the Hoſt of the Lord, when <hi>Joſhua</hi> likewiſe worſhipped him, as is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.13, 14. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11, 12. there is a glorious deſcription how he goes againſt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> at the <hi>Armageddon</hi> Battel, when he will deliver his people from that ſpiritual <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> bongage, &amp;c. as in many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Old and New Teſtament, which hereafter we may ſet down.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 4. <hi>God in his own inſtitutions and determinations is ſole judge of what is neceſſary for the accompliſhment of the whole work of redemption by Chriſt; and as to that the holy Scriptures onely can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve us; and for what is alleadged in the fourth Reaſon concerning the Old Teſtament may be anſwered, that ſuch things then which were myſtical, though wonderful, were more ſuitable to the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that regard Chriſt had not then actually taken upon himſelf his humane nature; and ſince his aſcention I think none can conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deny, but be ſpake perſonally to</hi> Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? <hi>and was perſonally ſeen of</hi> Steven <hi>at his death (if the Text be duly weighed) and why not afterward, when the Scripture is ſo evident? yea,</hi> Mr. Mede <hi>makes his appearance and ſpeaking unto</hi> Saul <hi>at his converſion to be a type of the way and means of the converſion of the Jews in time to come. And for that of the</hi> Armageddon <hi>battel it is to be conſidered as a prophetical Viſion and revelation of what will be really performed hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Chriſts bodily preſence upon earth was onely ſo far forth neceſſary as made for the accompliſhment of what his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102107:28"/>Spirit did foreſhew in the Old Teſtament, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hereby done as to his Prieſtly Office (till the day of judgement) input<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to all the typicall Sacrifices, by the once offering up of himſelf for the ſins of his people, and to bring in an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs (as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks) until he come as the great Judge of quick and dead.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 5. <hi>The Prophet</hi> Daniel <hi>doth as clearly ſpeak of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal coming at the deſtruction of Antichriſt; and</hi> Zachary <hi>of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen by every eye (then) as other Scriptures of the Old Teſtament ſpake of his coming to take our nature of the bleſſed Virgin and ſeed of</hi> David. <hi>And for the day of Judgement, this appearing will be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, as Mr.</hi> Mede <hi>aboundantly proves, and then coming to be perſonally and gloriouſly, as a King in the world, will ſo continue while the world endures</hi> (<hi>though how, at all times, in any place, ſaving in the new</hi> Jeruſalem) <hi>we cannot ſo fully according to Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Ever ſince his aſcention into Heaven, he hath and will improve his perfect oblation of himſelf for the ſins of his people at the right hand of God his Heavenly Father, by making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for his people perſonally in his humane nature, till the work of his mediation be fully perfected.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 6. <hi>The improving of his Office of Prieſthood at the right hand of God the Father in Heaven, ſeems limited to the time of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, when he will begin eminently and viſibly to make his foes his footſtool, as</hi> Pſal. 110. <hi>and if in another way by a preſential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for his people, when his Kingly glory ſhall more eminently ſhine forth, he may then do what God hath appointed, and in what concerns his Prieſtly Office accordingly, what ſhall remain for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his work of Mediation, and as God hath determined, it ſhall moſt certainly be done, but the holy Scriptures ſeems to limit his ſitting at Gods right hand to that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, By his ſo remaining there to that purpoſe is really fulfilled in him, the Antitype, what was typified by the High-Prieſt in the Old Teſtament, as the Apoſtle expounds it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26, 27, 28. As the High-Prieſt went once a year into the Holy of Holies to offer; ſo he was once offered in the end of the world, but not to appear bodily again till the Judgement, having put away ſin by that once offering up of himſelf, which the High-Prieſt under the Law by offering the blood of beaſts every year could not do, as the Apoſtle ſhews.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102107:28"/>
            <p>Anſwer. 7. <hi>What is there held out doth nothing contradict the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anſwer, being conſidered in the Scripture ſence, for ſo he doth it till the time ſpoken of, the day of judgement, as was before ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, While there is ſin in the Saints upon earth, there will be need of Chriſts perſonal mediation and interceſſion for them at Gods right hand; for as this was done typically from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall, in Sacrifices and Oblations, by Gods direction; and more eſpecially under the Ceremonial Law, according to his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial appointment in all particulars, until his once offering himſelf in the fleſh; ſo it is by him alone who is able to ſave his people to the uttermoſt, really and perfectly performed in the ſaid Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of mediation and interceſſion, and will be ſo till his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body ſhall be made perfect in all the members of it.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 8. <hi>That it will be done for place and continuance whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be needful for the accompliſhment of Chriſts Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it is not to be queſtioned: But in every thing, how after his great and glorious appearing formerly ſpoken of, that Office ſhall be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, happily we cannot yet fully determ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne. But for the place, of doing it at Gods right hand in heaven (as before was ſaid) the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſeems to limit to that period, of the eminent manifeſtation of his Kingly Office in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninethly, Becauſe he promiſed when he was aſcended he would draw all his Elect to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. which promiſe ſeems will not be fulfilled while any of them remain upon the earth, or till the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 9. <hi>That he hath ſpiritually and evidently drawn all ſorts of the Saints to him, hath in all ages, according to Scripture, been abundantly manifeſt many ways to beleiving ſouls; and that he will hereafter powerfully, not onely draw, but authoritatively and effic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, He is gone to prepare a place for all his Elect; now the Apoſtle ſhews that none ſhall prevent one another; ſo that the myſtical body of Chriſt muſt be comprea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and perfect,
<pb facs="tcp:102107:29"/>that an the members thereof may aſcend into glory together at once, with Chriſt Jeſus their myſtical head.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 10. <hi>The Doctrine of Chriſts Kingdom the thouſand years, doth nothing gainſay what is therein alleadged; neither ſhall the Saints prevent one another in the ſence there intended, but joyntly at the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that laſt Trumpet at the end of the world ſhall be changed in a moment, at the twinkling of an eye, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>and be rapt up to meet Chriſt in the air at once together, and thenceforth ever be with the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Eleventhly, The glory of Chriſt in heaven is ſuch as men in a mortal condition are not able to behold, as the Apoſtle ſhews, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.15, 16. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>onely hath immortality, dwelling in the light, which none can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, or can ſee.</hi> Now we may not conceive that Chriſt ſhould again denude himſelf of his glory which he hath ſo dearly purchaſed by his former humiliation and ſufferings, or at leaſt greatly diminiſh it, to come to remain with men perſonally upon earth.</p>
            <p>Anſ. 11. <hi>Though Chriſt ſhall not diminiſh his glory to be in the world, and be ſeen of men, when the Tabernacle of God is ſaid to be with men,</hi> Rev. 22. <hi>but rather accompliſh the end of his ſitting in glory with his Father in Heaven till that time, namely, to receive to himſelf a Kingdom, and then to return as be himſelf ſpeaketh,</hi> Luk. 19.12. <hi>Yet at his glorious appearing, he will manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf viſibly unto men, as vailing his glory with clouds for a time at leaſt, to be diſcernable by them: And how often or how long he may do ſo (being then in his Kingdom, the World, through whom even</hi> Abraham <hi>alſo is ſtiled</hi> Heir of the world by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſaith, <hi>as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,</hi> Rom. 4.13.) <hi>I ſee no ſufficient ground to determine; And I beleive many things will then be done by him that we cannot yet apprehend, neither are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us to know, but as he ſhall be pleaſed to reveal any of them, as uſeful to his Church hereafter.</hi>

                  <hi>Wherein are ſet down ſix ſeveral ſences of Chriſts coming recorded in the New Teſtament ſince his Aſcention, whereof the fifth is taken for his coming or appearing at the deſtruction of Antichriſt, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102107:29"/>whether it be to be underſtood myſtically or perſonally (how-ever wonderfully) diverſe things are offered to be conſidered, but left to the judicious Reader, duly to weigh and determine, as God by his. Word and Spirit may direct, onely reſolving that moſt ſurely one way of the two it will be at that time, and to that purpoſe, many evident Teſtimonies are occaſionally added, from thoſe four Apoſtles to whom Chriſt manifeſted his Kingly glory, namely, firſt to the three Diſcipls,</hi> Peter, James, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>in the Mount, and afterwrads to St.</hi> Paul, <hi>at his converſion, and in the laſt place are many conſiderable reſolves, many ways repreſented to ſuch as may ſeem to reaſon again-ſuch myſtical Doctrine.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>THus having briefly tendred ſome reaſons againſt Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal coming and appearing in the time when his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be eminently ſet up in the world, in the thouſand years ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. The thing we ſhall now endeavour concerning it, is to ſhew, that it is to be underſtood miſtically, though it is probably, wonderfully, and gloriouſly, and powerfully, to be fulfilled, when that time is come, though in many reſpects it may not be underſtood fully, till it be in actual being, but to that end we may the better underſtand what the Scripture ſpeaketh in reference hereto, we ſhall endeavour to repreſent the ſeveral ſenſes, wherein the coming of Chriſt is taken in ſeveral places, ſince his Aſcention into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is taken ſpiritually for his gracious coming unto his faithful and obedient Servants; So it is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me;</hi> Such ſhall find ſpiritual refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Chriſts, gracious approaches unto him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſts coming is taken for that glimps or ſhew of his glorious coming in his Kingdom, when he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured before his Diſciples, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. When his face ſhined as the ſun, and his raiment was white as the light,</hi> So <hi>Mark</hi> 9.1, &amp;c. <hi>Luke.</hi> 9.27. Concerning which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh remarkably, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16, 17. For we have not followed cunningly deviſed fables, when we made known unto you the power, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when their came ſuch a voyce to him from the excellent glory, <hi>this is my well beloved ſon, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> and this voice which came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:102107:30"/>we heard, when we were with him in the holy Mount.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sometimes the coming of Chriſt is taken for his viſional preſence, as he fore-ſignified, he would come to his Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in viſion, <hi>John</hi> 21.22. <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee;</hi> Some thereupon conceived that <hi>John</hi> ſhould not dye, from thoſe words, which ſenſe <hi>John</hi> denys there, but it was ſpoken of his outliving the reſt of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> even to the time that he was baniſhed by <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> for the teſtimony of Jeſus, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the firſt century, at which time Jeſus Chriſt came unto him in viſion, under diverſe appearances, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. when he began to give the Revelation to him, afterwards as a Lamb, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. afterwards as a Warrior on a white Horſe, conquering and to conquer, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. as a ſtrong Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. and as the Mighty King of Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and as the great Judge of all men, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>A fourth ſence of Chriſts coming may be that of Saint <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 5. the coming <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>the word is, And behold the Judge ſtandeth before the doors,</hi> which <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.9. ſeems to be meant of that ſpecial diſpenſative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our executive coming to fulfil his ſentence at <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſtruction by <hi>Veſpatian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> by which words the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> writing to the twelve Tribes ſcattered, <hi>viz.</hi> the belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews that were then Pilgrims from their own people for Chriſts Religion, ſtirs them up to patience, in regard Chriſt would fulfil his threatning againſt the obſtinate <hi>Jews,</hi> which as <hi>Joſephus</hi> and others relate, he then terribly did by fearful fights, voyces, and horrible deſolation, when an eleven hundred thouſand were deſtroyed and caſt in jakes, &amp;c. in that populous wicked City, beſides, above ſeventy thouſand carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſold for ſlaves; ſo this was a diſpenſative or executive coming at that time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is taken again for his wonderful powerful appearing, and glorious coming, to deſtroy Antichriſt and his adherents, and deliver his people, and ſet up his Kingdom, at the beginning of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. to the end. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 19, &amp; 20. Set forth by thoſe three Apoſtles, that were at his transfiguration in divers expreſſions, by his appearing, and coming, and the like, and likewiſe by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to whom he appeared gloriouſly, to convert him, who very remarkably ſpeaks of this coming, at the deſtruction of Antichriſt, whom

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with the appearance of his coming, as a Learned Linguiſt renders it, which our tranſlation turnes, with the brightneſs of his coming, but that it is the ſame coming, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. The Apoſtle here plainly ſhews concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts deſtruction, called the battel of <hi>Armageddon, Rev.</hi> 16. The not well obſerving of this hath occaſioned ſome, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learned men, to conclude Antichriſt ſhould continue to the end of the world; and <hi>Pareus</hi> often mentions the place in that ſenſe, which occaſioned him to ſet down the thouſand years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. from the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh; As Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to <hi>Auno.</hi> 1373. Though he ſpeaks of a glorious Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> wherein the other doth not agree with him; it is like upon the former account, that the world ſhould end with Antichriſt; from 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. which coming of Chriſts ſeems to be that that Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. where he ſaith, he comes with Clouds; which coming with Clouds ſeems neceſſary then to vail his glory, too great for mortal eyes other wiſe to behold, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (otherwiſe) <hi>no man hath ſeen him, nor can ſee him,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. therefore, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18.9, 11, 12. ſpeaks much of clouds to that purpoſe, and every eye ſhall ſee him, they ye alſo which peirced him, which ſeems to be in reference to the promiſe, <hi>Zac.</hi> 12.10. when his people ſhall mourn, with penitent contrition though many others then mourn, with bitter lamentation for the heavy judgements then upon the world, and great diſtrinction of evil men, &amp;c. of which again St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh very Emphatically, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Who ſhall judge hoth the quick and the dead at his appearing, and at his Kingdom;</hi> the wicked quick with temporal deſtruction, the faithful dead with recompence, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. for which he is there praiſed in a ſpecial manner, by the twenty four Elders at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, his coming is taken for the laſt great day of Judgement, decyphered by St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 20.11, 12. when <hi>ſitting upon a great white Throne, from whoſe face the Earth and the Heavens fled away, and there was found no place for them,

            <p>Now the fifth ſenſe of Chriſt coming ſince his aſcention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, is that we are to conſider; which ſeems to be ſet forth in Scripture, by many expreſſions, which coming of Chriſt was deſcribed to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in that Viſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11. to the end, where Chriſt as a moſt mighty and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, going to overthrow and utterly ruine his enemies, that is, Antichriſt and his Complices, at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet in the <hi>Armageddon</hi> battel, which coming is ſometimes expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102107:31"/>and others, in the Old Teſtament, but in the New, more to our purpoſe, we have a glimps of Chriſts Kingly glory, at his transfiguration, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with Chriſt, and what a ſtrang Revelation was that of Chriſt to <hi>Paul,</hi> before a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Perſecutor, at his Converſion by a light at Noon-day above the brightneſs of the Sun, to ſtrike him down and make him blind, till miraculouſly healed by <hi>Ananias,</hi> and by an audible voyce, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> What a wonderful Revelation was that of Chriſt to <hi>Stephen</hi> at his death? for to ſtrengthen his ſight to ſee the Heavens open, and Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God; God our Saviour, who is Lord and Chriſt, can fulfil his pleaſure any way he will, and he will infallibly do it, in that way his ſpirit hath foretold it, though the weak underſtandings of men, may not in ſome things, or the inlarged capacity of Angels, may not reach in every reſpect how God will fulfill his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it was at the Birth of Chriſt in many particulars. And that I may deal truly and ingeniouſly herein, I was the more engaged in ſuch a tenderneſs and moderation in this though greatly uſeful yet hitherto ſomewhat myſterious point of Doctrine, in that when I had drawn up the ſubſtance of my Reaſons againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal reign in a foul copy, by I know not what hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I ſuddenly and unwittingly fixed mine eye upon theſe words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. where is ſaid, <hi>When the ſeventh Angel begins to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed;</hi> which finiſhing, I ever before that time conceived ſhould not be till the laſt Judgement; and then comparing that with what is ſaid at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.18. where to the like effect it is ſaid, <hi>The Temple of God was opened in Heaven;</hi> Now the Temple of old ſignified Chriſts body, wherein the Godhead dwelled bodily; and he Temple in heaven might ſignifie ſome appearance of Chriſts humane nature then, which in the next words ſeem more evident, <hi>And there was ſeen in the Temple the Ark of his Teſtament;</hi> which phraſe imports ſome evident demonſtration of Gods grace in Chriſt <hi>[de modo]</hi> I determine nothing peremptorily: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidering what is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22, &amp;c. to this purpoſe of of the ſame time I obſerved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. at the new heavens and the new earth, the Tabernacle of God is ſaid to be with men, which may denote a near communion in a more unuſual manner then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and in the <hi>new Jeruſalem that came down from heaven, the Lord God Almighty &amp; the Lamb</hi> are ſaid both <hi>to be the light and the Temple

If <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſo ſtrengthened in faith, or ſight, at his death, to ſee the Heavens opened, and Chriſt in glory, ſitting at the right hand of God, Chriſt the great God, can make all, good and bad to behold his Majeſty, in what ever way he will then manifeſt himſelf, he can make the beams of his glory, beſides the divine light of his grace and Spirit ſtream down, and reſt as he pleaſeth, to inlighten his New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> come down from Heaven, (as to St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his converſion) to inlighten it, I ſay, far above the Sun at Noon-day; though his Humane Nature ſhould remain in the higheſt Heavens, he can make his Angels his Heraulds to execute his judgements upon his enemies, making thoſe Miniſters a flaming fire to them, and as Reapers, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of his Kingdome all things that offend, as thoſe Tares, the Children of the wicked one, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. for what execution of judgement is done by the Kings appointment and authority, though he is not pleaſed to be preſent in his perſon, is as well his execution as if he were ſo preſent, or did it with his own hand (as <hi>Samuel</hi> did to King <hi>Agag</hi>) what acts of Soveraignty, power or grace are performed, according
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102107:35"/>to his pleaſure and order, though in his perſonal abſence, are nevertheleſs to be acknowledged to be derived from him, and as the ſtar at Chriſts birth (though not a ſtar in the ordinary courſe) yet ſerved to lead the Sages to the place where Chriſt was:

Doth God by his Spirit, of his own goodneſs reveal ſo much for his Churches benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ſhall any think it not worth his enquiring into? What is not that wonderful Majeſty and glory of Chriſt to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obſerved? Is the peace and grace, holineſs and happineſ
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102107:36"/>of his Church, held out in Scripture abundantly in thoſe times, not worthy to be highly eſteemed and prized? Yea, ſhall ſuch multitudes of Saints have their portion in that heaven-born <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhall they not take notice of their priviledge? Is not the coming in of ſuch multitudes of Subjects to their great King of Kings, both of <hi>Iſraelites, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there ſeriouſly, faithfully and thankfully to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, beleived and improved, which in compariſon of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times will be as an harveſt to the after-gleanings, or the Vintage to the after-gatherings; Is not the ſalvation of ſuch vaſt numbers of beleiving ſouls in theſe grace-prevailing, ſanctified ſeaſons, that ſhall greatly honour Chriſt Jeſus in their times, and enjoy eternal happineſs afterward with him in heaven, be a matter of exceeding rejoycing to the fellow-members of Chriſts myſtical body? If the glorious Angels in Heaven rejoyce at the converſion of one ſinner that repents, as our Saviour ſpeaketh; how ſhould Gods people rejoyce by faith aforehand to ſee ſo many millions of millions that are then to come in to that glorious Church-ſtate on earth? If Gods faithful Servants have rejoyced in their ſeaſons paſt, when God hath proſpered their labours to bring home poor ſouls to Chriſt (though but a few many times) how ſhould it make the hearts of beleeving ſouls to exult, but even by faith to foreſee that day of ſalvation to come to Gods people (and with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo foreſeeing Chriſts firſt coming) ſo to rej yce beforehand as he did? Yea, is that the mainfruit of the travel of Chriſts ſoul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, 12. <hi>When he ſhall ſee his ſeed, and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> and wherein he himſelf ſhall be ſatisfied (as the Prophet there ſhews) and ſhall it not be the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all Gods people in theſe times to be aſſured thereof? If from about 600000 natural <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and ſuch as were born of them in forty years ſpace in the Wilderneſs, there is computed by learned and judicious Divines to have died above ſix millions in the Wilderneſs, when almoſt the ſame number entred into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> How many millions then, yea how many millions of millions may be conceived to ſpring up, and be educated in the faith of Jeſus Chriſt their King and Saviour in that thouſand years ſpace, when there ſhall be ſuch confluence of all Nations into the true Church, and when they will not be cut off in judgements, by untimely deaths (as many times great numbers of thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were) and is not ſuch bleſſedneſs and happineſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102107:36"/>of Gods Church reſerved for thoſe times upon many conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (if we duly weigh the many and large promiſes and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Scripture thereunto to be referred) of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as many ways, to all ſuch as rejoyce in the happineſs of Gods choſen, and would glory with his inheritance? It is then likely there will be a ſtrange holy contention upon earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people, (as the holy Spirit ſeems to imply concerning thoſe times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3) ſaying, <hi>(And his ſervants ſhall ſerve him</hi>) whether God or his people ſhould do better each towards other, that is, as I may ſay, what is within the reach and ſphere of their activity; For Chriſt will greatly exalt his people under that his dominion, and they by his grace will be ſuch, as the more he exalts them, the more they will rejoyce to exalt him; and the more they exalt him, the more he will inlarge them both with grace and glory; and the larger their portion of grace ſhall be, the greater will be their peace, ſecurity, and happineſs.</p>
            <p>And this will be the more and more conſtant in that regard, the interrupting and corrupting cauſes thereof, which might otherwiſe hinder as formerly, ſhall then in a very great degree by his kingly power and goodneſs, be removed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; when Satan the Tempter is bound and ſhut up in his bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, and ſtrong tentations proceeding at other times from the prevalency of the corruption of men, ſhall be much abandoned; provocations much removed, natural corruption manacled and fettered, and in many (as it is probable) very greatly ſuppreſſed, and accordingly grace, holineſs, inward peace, and with them conſequently outward peace, proſperity, and all kind of ſecurity that is ſuitable to that condition, and how will this work upon the ſanctified ſpirits of that happy ſeed and generation, bleſſed of God, to conſider ſtill with holy <hi>David, What ſhall we render unto the Lord our King and Saviour, for all ſuch his goodneſs conferred upon us?</hi> So that if men have any Chriſtian frame of ſpirit upon them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but upon ſuch conſiderations think of, and inquire into the Kingdom of Chriſt to come on earth; as many ways worth the while; except they be onely carnal Goſpellers, that only make worldly marchandiſe thereof, but otherwiſe regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace nor glory for themſelves or others, or at leaſt are conſcious to themſelves, that they have no part in either; Yet even ſuch by the due conſideration of theſe things (by

            <p>And as God and Satan have had their deſigns in theſe; ſo God in his word hath uſed three eminent Chronologers, to keep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of theſe three <hi>Babylonian</hi> deſigns of Satan, and to record ſuch things concerning them all, whereby the Devils evil purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might be diſcovered, and the miſcheif enſuing to the ſeduced might be apprehended, and the help and remedies which God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince hath provided againſt them might be made known for his Churches ſupport and comfort.</p>
            <p>Theſe three eminent Chronologers are firſt the Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> in whoſe writings three parts are obſervable.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, A prophetical revelation of things concerning Gods Church, and Chriſt the Meſſiah to come, and concerning his three great offices of a Prophet, Prieſt and King, though in ſome things darkly, yet very certainly (as by Gods aſſiſtance we may ſhew) for we muſt obſerve that the Spirit of Chriſt by the miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Pentateuch, or five books written by him, hath ſet down the ſubſtance of all Chriſtian Religion (though in ſome things darkly) concerning the times of the Goſpel, and that, and all the Old Teſtament is but <hi>Novum Velatum,</hi> the <hi>New vailed,</hi> as the New Teſtament afterwards is but in ſubſtance <hi>Vetus Revelatum,</hi> the <hi>Old revealed,</hi> Chriſt having by his Prophetical ſpirit in the firſt revealed the whole counſel of his Father, for the benefit of his Church.</p>

            <p>The ſecond Chronologer, concerning the ſecond and third <hi>Babel,</hi> is the greatly beloved Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord we may obſerve that he ſaith nothing of what was done before his time, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did from the beginning of the world, having none before him, (for that God from <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, had done by others ſucceſſively in Scripture, to <hi>Daniels</hi> time) therefore his records were firſt of things in his own time; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of all times after to come, though ſomewhat more clearly then <hi>Moſes</hi> therein; the third of thoſe eminent Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers, was the beloved Diſciple St. <hi>John,</hi> who beginning at his own time towards the end of the firſt Century after Chriſt, from thence proceeds to make known the pleaſure of God concerning all times afterwards, as Chriſt Jeſus by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in the book of his Revelation had declared unto him, to the end of the world, myſtically ſet before him in many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to be ſent unto the Churches, for their information and comfort unto the end.</p>

            <p>Again, In <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Daniel,</hi> after the Viſion of the four Beaſts, hath the expoſition of the fourth ſpecially given him, which though as ſome conceive, there is an hiſtorical and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſence in ſome reſpects obſerveable; and <hi>Antiochius Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> ſignified by the little horn, &amp;c. which (happily) may not be denyed, for many Scriptures have both an Hiſtorical and myſtical ſence, and Propheſies of ſeveral things, are ſometimes much interwoven, (as <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the world) yet again, by ſome learned and judicious men, theſe things are either applyed literally, or at leaſt myſtically or typically, to the times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, to which it is very aptly applicable, both in regard of the ſtrength and prevalency of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and the long continuance thereof, and in the ſpecial reſemblances of the Antichriſtian power, and ſtate afterward, and even the very phraſes in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> are applied to the Pope, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. but after this, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. it follows, <hi>the Kingdom, the Dominon, the greatneſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (note the expreſſions) <hi>ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe Kingdom is an everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him;</hi> and this can belong to no other but Chriſt, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. and of theſe times all the Prophets ſpeak ſucceſſively, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. and further, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. which ſeems to be a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102107:40"/>of ſeveral things concerning thoſe times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and Chriſts Kindom ſucceeding it, wherein ſeems firſt to be ſet forth ſecretly, by the ſtanding up of <hi>Michael</hi> their Prince, what the book of <hi>Revelation</hi> gives light to in ſundry particulars, therein briefly couched; The appearing or coming of Chriſt, or ſtanding up for his People (as <hi>Daniel,</hi> to deſtroy Antichriſt; the Feet and toes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, together with the remainder of his ten horns) with ſuch a terrible deſtruction as never was ſince there was a Nation, to that ſame time, and then his people ſhould be delivered, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. having ſpoken briefly and darkly of the reſurrection of the dead, which is more largely explained, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. (which happily may be meant of the laſt general reſurrection, after the finiſhing the happy times, after his peoples delivery before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) or rather, to be underſtood of the civil reſurrection of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> prophetied, Ezek. 37. when they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one ſtick; when ſuch as are faithful and ſtrengthen others will be renowned, but back-ſliders contemptible. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. having ſpoken ſomewhat of the recompence that ſhould be given to the faithful meſſongers of the Goſpel, and all ſuch as turn many to righteouſneſs, then at the begining of the 4. <hi>verſ. Daniel</hi> is commanded to ſhut up the words, and ſeal the book, even unto the time of the end, and when <hi>Daniel</hi> was deſirous to know the end of theſe things, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. there ſeem two marks of the time of the end fore ſpoken of, which <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, though he heard, yet he underſtood them not, and yet though he deſired to know, it was not then granted, for <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>the words are ſealed,</hi> &amp;c.

               </gap> (as <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.) and to cauſe the knowledge of Chriſt and his Goſpel to abound. Or elſe, by running too and fro, may be ſignified, that though then many received the Goſpel, and took up a profeſſion of it for a time, yet by tentations and perſecutions, many left again the owning
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102107:41"/>of that profeſſion, and yet notwithſtanding abundance of light and knowledge did then ſhine out in the primative Churches, though they were greatly perſecuted.</p>
            <p>The other mark of the times before the ſaid end, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> acknowledged, he then underſtood not, ſeems to be ſet forth, not onely by the ſaid Series of times given to St. <hi>John</hi> in the Revelation, but to make the ſence of the former more ſuitable to the truth in <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. there is the peculiar ſtamps, ſet upon thoſe next times, that in the Revelation are plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained what times they be, <hi>viz.</hi> The date of the Beaſt, or times of Antichriſt, which ſucceeded the ſaid primitive times (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. namely, <hi>the time and times, and half,</hi> wherein the woman, the true Church, was to be in her wilderneſs-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of his tyranny and wickedneſs, and to make it more evident, there is deſcribed one in white Linnen, who is ſaid to ſwear, that thoſe things ſhould be finiſhed then, when (he) that is Antichriſt, <hi>ſhall have accompliſhed to ſeatter the power of the holy people, the Saints;</hi> Then (ſaith he) <hi>theſe things ſhall be.</hi> So the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. which denotes Chriſt (as the learned and judicious do conceive) ſwears that time ſhould be no more, that is (ſay they) the worlds time under Satans rule, under ſuch powers as formerly, for the moſt part. And that the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed, even at the beginning of the ſeventh Trumpet. Yet though <hi>Daniel</hi> underſtood not the ſaid markes of the ſaid time, in reſpect of the Gentile Church, yet he hath others given, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Jewiſh Church, which ſet forth the converſion of his people the Jews, which though unto us it ſeems diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to find the <hi>Epocha</hi> thereof, the thouſand two hundred and ninety days, which is conceived to be about the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Julians</hi> time, and if ſo, ſeems to approach nigh, pointing out the Jews firſt converſion, and forty five years after, the glorious times expected to appear, or happily about the pouring out the ſeventh Vial, Antichriſts laſt deſtruction, &amp;c. Onely in the concluſion <hi>Daniel</hi> hath this conſolation given him, that he ſhall ſtand in the lot at the end of the ſaid days, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. Now what theſe famous prophetical Chronologers have ſo foreſhewed, formerly more darkly, Chriſt hath ſince, by his beloved Diſciple St. <hi>John,</hi> more clearly and largely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed concerning the excellency of Chriſts Kingdom on earth, as we have in ſome meaſure ſet down before.</p>

            <p>Firſt, by a frame of Doctrine tending this way, whence ſundry arguments according to Scripture might be drawn.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By a Viſional repreſentation of new and old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Doctrine, ſutable thereunto, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4, 5. chap.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the paſſages and expreſſions of Scripture in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles writings, holding out ſuch a Kingdom of Chriſt in one ſence or other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By the frame of the main hiſtorical and prophetical Chronocles of the three eminent Chronologers of all times, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Moſes, Daniel</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having (through Gods ſpecial grace) proceeded hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, we ſhall endeavour a little to repreſent ſomewhat of that we hinted before, concerning the three <hi>Babels,</hi> in thoſe three eminent Chronicles, and according to their ſeveral diſtinctions in the ſeveral times made relation of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtory. 2. Of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>y of <hi>Babel</hi> in <hi>Daniels</hi> time. 3. Of the myſtical <hi>Babel,</hi> reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to St. <hi>John,</hi> being the feet and toes of the great Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. all which, with the evil of them by Satans deſigns, Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſtroys, to all their utter confuſions; according as St. <hi>Johns</hi> reſolve, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſt, to deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which three we may obſerve, Firſt, Satans deſign in each of his <hi>Babels</hi> of confuſion <hi>[for wickedneſs ſhall not be eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth]</hi> Secondly, The way of Gods croſſing and confounding his deſigns in them. Thirdly, Chriſts remedy againſt them all.</p>
            <p>God promiſed Chriſt the Mediator to overthrow Satans firſt and great attempt againſt all mankind in our firſt parents.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Ever ſince Chriſt as Mediator, hath been fitted to help his Church againſt all Satans attempts, ever ſince that in his juſtice ſuch emnity was put between the ſeed of the Serpent and the ſeed of the woman.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The building the firſt <hi>Babel,</hi> another inſtigation to pride, lifting up man againſt God (as at the fall) becauſe the people
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102107:42"/>were before of one language and one ſpeech, and being then ſo long liv'd for many hundreds of years, could largely relate at all times, in all places, and to all ſorts of perſons upon any occaſion, the works and wonders of God, and what they had received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Creation and fall of man, and the promiſes of grace, and what worſhip God had inſtituted among them from time to time, Satan knew this was a great advantage to the firſt Fathers to fit them to ſerve God and glorifie his name, which was the end of all his mercies and wonderful works; therefore his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign then ſeemed to be by tempting them by ſuch pride and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own glory, by building a Tower to get them a name, and as if they did emulate God himſelf, to reach up to heaven, and ſo to prevent their diſperſion on the earth, or drowning by another deludge, that ſo by their abuſing their oneneſs of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to provoke God, they might by that means be deprived of that great benefit; for Satan too well knows if men will be ſeduced to abuſe the greateſt mercies, its the ready way for them to loſe them: thereupon God confounds their pride in building their <hi>Babel,</hi> and ſo deprives them of their former advantage of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and happineſs in their former oneneſs of language, and by that confuſion of tongues inflicted the ſaddeſt judgement upon mankind that ever befel them ſince the firſt fall, taking from them thereby the advantage of Piety, of commendable Policy, and even in a great degree the exerciſe of Humanity and Civility, and Satan hath improved the miſcheif of this judgement mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ways ever ſince through all ages, which the ſtories of all times may ſet down large and ſad Comments of, by diviſions, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, wars, and all manner of injuries and violence of parties againſt parties, of ſeveral tongues and languages, and conſequently hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion thereby; as alſo by the hardneſs to get knowledge, even with great ſtudy and labour, and the danger when gotten to be abuſed, to maintain <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and to eclipſe the truth more often then to clear it (as experience hath manifeſted) whence endleſs miſcheifs have proceeded through all times, which we can now onely hint at.</p>
            <p>But Chriſts help againſt this for the Church, hath been by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more largely the holy Spirit of Wiſdom and Truth in his Church, to reveal unto his ſervants, and by them unto his people in all ſucceſſions of ages, ſuch things as in the counſel of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had to reveal: And when he had finiſhed the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and once made his perfect oblation for the ſins of his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102107:42"/>people, he gave teſtimony of his helping (as by a <hi>preludium</hi>) the confuſſion of tongues at the firſt <hi>Babel,</hi> by the gift of tongues to the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. when cloven tongues like fire ſate upon each of them, and by other gifts of the holy Ghoſt conferred on others in thoſe primitive times, as in a glimpſe (as it were) to foreſhew what he would do in his Kingdom for that people of the Jews, who had but then their firſt fruits at that time come in to Chriſt, and (as it were) to declare what he will more plentifully do, when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and when they ſhall be a people of a pure language, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.9. and when they ſhall be of one language and one ſpeech, and the Lord One, and his Name One, <hi>Zac.</hi> 14.9. as if then when Satan is caſt into his priſon, his deſign in the confuſion of Languages ſhould end, and utterly fail, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem thoſe ſpiritual promiſes, mainly to have their drift. That they ſhould not need to be taught any more to know the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. and that they ſhould all be taught of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. which is now onely in a leſſer degree, and but comparatively hitherto for the moſt part fulfilled, unleſs in the Apoſtles times, and ſuch as were extraordinarily inſpired, but I ſhall onely here hint at theſe things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Satans deſign in the ſecond Babel ſeems to be upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he had by the firſt, to wit, the diviſion of tongues and confounding language, for though God diſcovered and preſerved all needful truth for his Church, among ſuch as were faithful and holy perſons, and all ſuch needful knowledge, by reaſon of thoſe long liv'd firſt Fathers, by a very few hands from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> might be conveyed, as from <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Jared, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time (which <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſome conceive to be <hi>Shem</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah</hi>) or by a few others; yet after this, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> became ſlaves under <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage (unworthily from men, though happily they might have provoked God) they might looſe much of their traditional knowledge; Yet withal it is remarkable, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were famous for Hierogliphick learning (happily by <hi>Joſephs</hi> means) who interpreted many Dreams and Viſions, which might occaſion ſuch kind of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which afterwards they groſly abuſed; And <hi>Moſes</hi> by means of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, was afterwards trained up in all the learning of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> But when God uſed the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to bring his people out of that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102107:43"/>he ſet up an inſtituted Church, and as he wrote the tables of the Law himſelf; So he directed <hi>Moſes</hi> in writing his five Books for the benefit of his Church; Yet doubtleſs that excellent faculty of writing hath been likewiſe much after that time abuſed by Satan and evil men likewiſe, to eclipſe truth, and promote errors amongſt all Heathen people; For that as God had by that means ſet down the ſum of his true Religion, for that generation of the children of the godly <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and Fathers, and after forty years made their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity a famous Nation and people, and by degrees were formed into a glorious ſtate and Kingdom, in the end of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi> and begin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing of <hi>Solomons</hi> reign; So Satan had all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long an apparent deſign to raiſe huge Mountains of tyranny in the world, to ſerve his own purpoſes in his wicked Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thereby to promote Atheiſm and Idolatry, and what ever was evil, and to overpower, oppreſs, and ſubdue (if it were poſſible) Gods Church, and profeſſed people, and ſo far as their ſins gave advantage from time to time, they did ſo; by the juſt hand of Gods providence, moſt wiſely and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſteering and ordering all the affairs of the world, to his own glory, and the fulfilling of his own holy pleaſure, when Satan and evil men leaſt intend it; making them in ſuch caſes, like refiners to his people, to cleanſe them from their droſs, and though ſeveral Infidel and Idolatrous Nations, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſoon after <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua's</hi> time (as in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> and the following ſtories in Scripture may appear many times) until <hi>Davids</hi> victorious, and <hi>Solomons</hi> flouriſhing Kingdom, which in the next ſucceſſion Satan by his engins of Idolatry and wickedneſs, ſoon found a way to divide, to make way for his own rule in the world, and upon the ten tribes revolting, got the greateſt part, even of <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelf, to turn to his ſide, and promote his deſign for the moſt part,
<note place="margin">Helvic.</note> till at the laſt the height of their ſins, and the fulneſs of their iniquity, delivered them up into the hands of their <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> conquerours, under which captivity they have lain above 2400 years; and ſtill by the like means and actings Satan afterward raiſed a greater mountain of oppoſition againſt Gods Church, when advantage againſt them might be obtained, and <hi>Judahs</hi> ſin was likewiſe ripe, ſo that the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> rod that ſcourged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before being burnt in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> furnace, theſe alſo might be caſt and faſhioned that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102107:43"/>head of gold, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, which by its maſſie weight, meeting together with <hi>Judahs</hi> ſins, written with a pen of <hi>Iron,</hi> and with the point of a Diamond, might grind that people almoſt to powder, wherein Satans deſigns ſeemed to attain their end.</p>
            <p>But now for a remedy for this, God reveals by <hi>Daniel,</hi> as was fore-ſhewed, that though Satan at the preſent ſeemed wholly to have wone the victory, yet he ſhould not always wear it; but that firſt he would break in peices that head of gold, by a meaner mettle, (and ſo make uſe of the ſucceeding breaſts and arms of ſilver) <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> and that not onely to deſtroy the ſaid golden head, but alſo as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed graciouſly by his Prophet concerning <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom he therefore ſtiled his Shepheard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.28. to reduce his people in a wonderful manner again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build by a ſtrange munificence and aſſiſtance his Temple there, and though for their crying ſins, they were afterward in the two following Monarchies of Braſs and Iron, namely, the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> long and ſoar afflicted, they were alſo at length, (after the Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated) by the Iron legs and thighs of the moſt terrible <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> power, wholly made deſolate, upon their rejection and crucifying the Lord of life and glory, the true King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> had acknowledged him) <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. But when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe heads of that monſtrous <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, explained to <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7. but more to St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 17. had ſucceſſively paſſed their ſeaſons, and when he that letted, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. was taken out of the way, Satan then found advantage to erect another, and worſe then the former <hi>Babel;</hi> namely,</p>
            <p>That which is the third <hi>Babel,</hi> to wit, the Myſtical, under the great Antichriſt the Pope, wherein Satans deſign by wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that proud, cruel, and wicked Tyrant cunningly into his own ſeat and authority, by hypocritical pretences, to make that foul beaſt to defile and poyſon the waters of life, and by ſtrong and ſtrange deluſions, ſo to hinder and aboliſh both the truth and power of Chriſts new conſtituted Religion in the world, as far as he could reach, wherein his evil deſign hath likewiſe greatly prevailed for above twelve hundred years paſt.</p>
            <p>But for help and remedy againſt this myſtical <hi>Babel</hi> alſo, Chriſt aforehand ſhewed unto his beloved Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102107:44"/>by him to his Churches ſucceſſively, the utmoſt period of his continuance, and manner of his now approaching ruine, as of the Dragons before; and that the ſaid Beaſt likewiſe, when the term of his Kingnom was out, muſt with it, go into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and be caſt into a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting the perpetual ruine of all Antichriſtian Tyranny, and an utter end of all wicked dominion, being the laſt and loweſt parts of the ſaid Image (to wit) the feet and toes according to the interpretation given to <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 2. and at whoſe deſtruction the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed in the world, as the expreſſion of the Spirit of Chriſt is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.17. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. when the whole of what was revealed to St. <hi>John,</hi> concerning the Beaſts riſe and ruine (as was before noted) ſhould all in ſuch ways as he hath ſet down, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; <hi>viz.</hi> by the prophecyings of the two ſack-cloth witneſſes, and the pouring out of the ſeven laſt plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Beaſts worldly excellency, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, <hi>and</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> So that then the Kingdoms of the world ſhall be the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and be given to the Saints of the moſt high, as before, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. So that as all the Devils deſignes, and Gods had run counter before; ſo by Chriſt theſe have all along been ſo managed, that at length the uſurped Dominion of Satan, will be utterly ſubverted, and the decreed Monarchy of Jeſus Chriſt, muſt be compleated in this world, under or after the ſeventh Trumpet, as a ſtep to his eternal perfection of glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with his whole myſtical body, the true Church in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his father, which as mediatour, he will reſign up to him at the end, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, 1 Cor. 15.4.</p>
            <p>Now as by the miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt of Chriſts Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians were confounded: As by the ſpirit of Wiſdom, given by Chriſt to <hi>Daniel,</hi> the ſecond Chronologer, the Aſtrologers, Caldeans and South ſayers of <hi>Babylon</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: So by the Spirit and Word of Chriſts Teſtimony, in the mouth of his ſackcloth Prophets, according to Saint <hi>John</hi> the third Chronologer, the ſubtilty of the man of fin is quite defeated, and he himſelf with his cheif followers made utterly deſolate, and caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone; ſo that thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the Devil, the wicked one, uſurped a rule in the world in the hands of his evil powers abuſing ſuch their authority, for the moſt part, for the promoting of evill, and hindering or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102107:44"/>of any good; ſo afterwards Chriſt will put all his authority under his reign and dominion in the world into good hands, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and hinder evil, and to maintain and advance good: which (happily) may be the advantage Satan may take at the end of the 1000 years, to ſtir up the wicked at that time in the world, to attempt againſt Chriſts true Church at the laſt, to caſt off their iron yoke (as to them it may ſeem) which they have been ſo long held under by, and to ſtrive to break thoſe bands aſunder, and to caſt away ſuch cords of good Government from them, as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2. But then, <hi>He that ſits in heaven will laugh them to ſcorn,</hi> and by ſuch means deſtroy both Satan and his followers; and while ſo they ſeek to encompaſs the camp of the Saints, they will find Chriſt come at laſt againſt them, for ever to deſtroy both Satan and them, when the Devil with his hoſt of evil men ſhall be ſent after the Beaſt and falſe Prophet into the lake of fire and brimſtone, <hi>which is the ſecond death;</hi> never any more to commit or work, or even further to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any miſchief in the world, and ſo caſting Death and Hell with them into the ſame deſtruction, <hi>Revl</hi> 20.10, 14. Chriſt will have the perfect victory when all his enemies are ſo put under his feet.</p>
            <p>And thus we may obſerve how notwithſtanding all Satans <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> of confuſion, Chriſts Kingdom ſhall be ſet up, both to put an end to all ſuch his deſigns, and to put an end to all ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, ſave onely that which after he ſhall be looſed for a little ſeaſon, will put an end to all his actings in the world, and of all his ſeed, and uſher in all their miſery eternally in Hell; but in all the thouſand years before that, neither he nor they ſhall be ſuffered to annoy Gods ſervants, but that will really be fulfilled in the time of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which ſhall come down from heaven, which will be her priviledge, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. <hi>[And his ſervants ſhall ſerve him.]</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving conſidered what in the three great Chronologers is obſervably ſpoken of our Saviours Kingdom upon earth, we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102107:45"/>ſhall by Gods gracious aſſiſtance proceed in the method, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reſt which our Saviour himſelf after his reſurrection directeth us unto, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.43. <hi>It is written</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of me in</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Prophets and the Pſalms;</hi> endeavouring to obſerve ſome things further out of the other Prophets to this purpoſe; and to come to ſpeak of what is recorded in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Kingdom of Chriſt, wherein that eminent ſweet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo abundantly tune forth ſuch melodious ſtreins thereof, and even upon occaſion of his own Kingdom and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> delivereth ſuch great things in reference to Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which could not have their accompliſhment in any other then him that was the eternal ſon of God.</p>
            <p>And the like may be obſerved in all the enſuing Propheſies of Gods ancient people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> the ſubjects (in cheif) of that Kingdom, as likewiſe of their moſt glorious King and Governour, who will then be manifeſt to them; and we have the covenant of God in reſpect both of theſe Subjects and of their great King made with <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a type, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. but looking at Chriſt, <hi>wherein conſiſted the ſure mercies of David,</hi> which are largely illuſtrated both by Gods free and gracious promiſe by both; in <hi>Nathans</hi> meſſage, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. ſhewing that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be planted in their own place, and move no more, nor afflicted any more by the ſons of wickedneſs, <hi>verſe</hi> 11, And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaking of the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, though as in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> and in his ſucceſſors, his naturall race might ſorely ſuffer, yet in a heavenly King the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the Son of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. applied <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. there is ſtability aſcertained: and ſo <hi>Davids</hi> faith and prayer improve it with much grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken of thy ſervants houſe a great while to come,</hi> and v. 26. <hi>Let thy ſervants houſe be eſtabliſhed for ever;</hi> and ſo again <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. this covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. could be in none but Chriſt the Meſſiah. That the Propheſies and Promiſes that follow concerning both, never yet had any ſuitably fulfilling, nor can have, other ways then in ſuch a wonderful way and glorious manner, as is peculiar to the Kingdom of Chriſt at ſuch his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. which as they have been ſtrangely wreſted to avoid a litteral ſence by ſome, ſo have they been ſufficiently cleared by others to contain it; ſo that the evident clearneſs, and great vigour in ſo many Scripture Teſtimonies, cannot but work upon ſuch teachable ſpirits as this abridgement is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. It is counted policy, though wicked, in ſlandering <hi>(ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102107:45"/>audacter, haerehit aliquid;)</hi> So, in ſo great abundance of Teſtimonies of truth, upon good Chriſtian policy we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently aſſert, for in ſuch clearneſs ſomething will remain, to wit, to ſuch as are not more diſpoſed to ſhut their eyes againſt Scripture light, then to open them to behold it: I ſhall but as it were, paſs through them, becauſe I aim at brevity, the large diſcuſſion being done by others already, and eſpeciall in the ſecond and third books of <hi>The dawning of the Day-ſtar,</hi> compoſed by Dr. <hi>Nath. Homes,</hi> wherein very learnedly and judiciouſly ſuch Scripture-Propheſies and Texts reſpecting the <hi>quod ſit, That there is ſuch a Kingdom of Chriſt to come on earth in the thouſand years,</hi> are very clearly and convincingly opened and applied thereunto, which I had opportunity to peruſe ſince theſe brief collections, who both ſtrongly aſſerts the truth therein, and very ſatisfactorily afterwards anſwers what things have been objected to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where I am well aſſured that intelligent perſons (by Gods aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) may finde more clear reſolution, as reſpecting thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Scriptures and Propheſies through the whole book of God, then in many large Commentaries of moſt Writers on them, for many hundred of years laſt paſt, which differ therein from the moſt pure Primitive times.</p>
            <p>Now among the Prophets look firſt into that Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who is abundant to the purpoſe, where we ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take ſome few at preſent, to prove that ſuch a Kingdom of Chriſt is to come, and refer the great things foretold by him and others concerning that Kingdom to be conſidered in another place.</p>

            <p>The next is the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who in chap. 3.17. tells us <hi>At that time</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be called the throne of the Lord, and all the Nations ſhall be gathered to it to the name of the Lord to</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>neither ſhall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.</hi> Another clear and vigorous Propheſie is ſet down, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. <hi>Behold the days, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto</hi> David <hi>a righteous Branch, and a King ſhall riſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, and execute judgement and juſtice in the earth.</hi> Verſe 6. <hi>In his days</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is the name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> And to the like purpoſe again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.15, 16. <hi>In thoſe days and at that time will I cauſe the branch of Righteouſneſs to grow up unto</hi> David, <hi>and he ſhall execute judgement and righteouſneſs in the land.</hi> Verſe 16. <hi>In thoſe days ſhall</hi> Judah <hi>be ſaved, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102107:46"/>dwell ſafely, and this is the name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our righteouſneſs;</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> David <hi>ſhall never want a man to ſit upon the Throne of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael; and <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>If ye can break my Covenant of the day, and my Covenant of the night, and that there ſhall not be day and night in their ſeaſon, then may alſo my Covenant be broken with</hi> David <hi>my ſervant, that he ſhall not have a Son to reign on his Throne;</hi> and the like again repeated in the, 25, and 26. <hi>verſes.</hi> The places are ſo clear and full, I ſpare to ſpeak any thing to apply them, becauſe they cannot juſtly and rationally be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied otherways, and ſuch as underſtand them onely ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſay ſomething, but not all, nor that which they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally drive at, namely, that ſpecial period of Chriſts reign upon earth, whither the current of Such Scriptures lead; and after all, our Saviour himſelf abundantly in the Revelation, inſtructs his people, and all ſuch as will not willfully ſhut their eyes againſt the light.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> likewiſe ſpeaks very clearly, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.23, 24. <hi>And I ſet up one Shepherd over them, and he ſhall feed them, even my ſervant</hi> David, <hi>he ſhall feed them, and he ſhall be their Shepherd,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>I the Lord will be their God, and my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> David <hi>a Prince among them, I the Lord have ſpoken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, As evidently doth he ſpeak of Chriſts reign, <hi>Chap.</hi> 37. After that he had ſpoken of the joyning of the ſtick of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> into one, he ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>And I will make them one Nation in the land, upon the Mountain of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and one King ſhall be the King to them all, and they ſhall be no more two Nations, neither ſhall they be divided into two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms any more at all,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. David <hi>my ſervant ſhall be King over them, and they ſhall have one Shepherd, and they ſhall alſo walk in my judgements, and obſerve my ſtatutes, and do them,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>And they ſhall dwell in the land that I have given unto</hi> Jacob <hi>my ſervant, wherein your Fathers have dwelt, and they ſhall dwell therein; they and their Children, and their Childrens Children for ever, and my ſervant</hi> David <hi>ſhall be their Prince for ever.</hi> And in thoſe nine laſt Chapters of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> which learned and judicious men conceive to be the Revelation of the Old Teſtament, where the holy Prophet had high myſteries of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> imparted to him, and amongſt the reſt, there are obſerveable many things ſet forth concerning the Prince, and what order of ſtate belonged
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102107:47"/>to him, and in concluſion, he ſaith, <hi>The City ſhall be called at that day, viz.</hi> the time of Chriſts raign <hi>(Jehovah Shamma) the Load is there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Then ſhall the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Judah, <hi>be gathered together, and ſhall appoint themſelves one head, and ſhall come up out of the land, for great ſhall be the day of</hi> Jezreel, which never yet was fulfilled, but ſhall be in its time; So again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Afterward ſhall the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>return and ſeek the Lord their God, and</hi> David <hi>their King, and ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs in the latter days,</hi> which can have no adequate accompliſhment, but in Chriſts Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To the like purpoſe the Prophet <hi>Joel, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> having in <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. ſhewed what a terrible deſtruction ſhall be, when Chriſt ſhall make his foes his foot-ſtool, and ſet up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. he ſaith, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be delivered; for in Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be deliverance, as the Lord hath ſaid, and in the remnant whom the Lord ſhall call,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.2, laſt <hi>Verſes, And</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall dwell for ever, and</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>from generation to generation; for I will cleanſe their blood, that I have not cleanſed, for the Lord dwelleth in</hi> Zion.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> alſo fully witneſſeth to this Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.11, 12. <hi>In that day will I raiſe up the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of</hi> David, <hi>which was fallen, and cloſe up the breaches thereof; and I will raiſe up the ruines, and will build it, as in the days of old;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>That they may poſſeſs the remnant of</hi> Edom, <hi>and all the Heathen, that are called by my name, ſaith the Lord that doth this,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>I will bring again the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of my people of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and they ſhall build the waſte Cities and inhabit them, and they ſhall plant Vineyards, and drink the wine thereof, they ſhall alſo make gardens, and eat the fruit of them, and I will plant them upon their Land, and they ſhall no more be pulled up out of their Land, which I have given to them, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even <hi>Obadiah</hi> in his ſhort Prophefie, hath high expreſſions of the deliverance on Mount <hi>Sion, verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>And there ſhall be holineſs, and the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall poſſeſs their poſſeſſions.</hi> But more direct to our preſent purpoſe, <hi>verſe ult. And Saviours ſhall come up to Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>to judge the Mount of</hi> Eſau, <hi>and the Kingdom ſhall be the Lords.</hi>

            <p>Herein is likewiſe the Propheſie of <hi>Micab</hi> very evident, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. <hi>In the laſt days it ſhall come to paſs</hi> (which words, <hi>the laſt days,</hi> we may obſerve frequently to be uſed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and the like) <hi>that the Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord, ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the Mountains, and it ſhall be exalted above the hills, and the people ſhall flow unto it,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>Many Nations ſhall come and ſay, let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths, for the law ſhall go forth of</hi> Sion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem; and <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>He ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong Nations afar off, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. when he had ſpoken of ſmiting the Judge of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a rod on the cheek; <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. he then ſhews that out of <hi>Beth-leem Ephratah,</hi> ſhall go, he that was to be ruler in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe going forth have been from of old from everlaſting; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>He ſhall ſtand and feed in the ſtrength of the Lord, and in the Majeſty of the name of the Lord his God, and they ſhall abide, for now ſhall be be great unto the ends of the earth.</hi>

            <p>In the next place amongſt the Teſtimonies of the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, proceed we to the Prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> who is as clear herein as any of the former (and being after the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> can leaſt be interpreted of that which was paſt) <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſts; Behold
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102107:48"/>the man whoſe name is the</hi> Branch, <hi>and he ſhall grow up out of his place, and he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, and he ſhall bear the glory, and ſhall ſit and rule on the Throne</hi> (So that <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> to whom this was ſpoken, was but a dim ſhade to this mighty Prince) <hi>and he ſhall he a Prieſt upon the Throne, and the counſel of peace ſhall be between them both;</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.8. <hi>I will bring them, and they ſhall be in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and righteouſneſs; Again,</hi> Chap. 9.16. <hi>And the Lord their God ſhall ſave them in that day, as the flock of his people, for they ſhall be as the ſtones of a Crown lifted up, as an enſign upon his land.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>How great is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how great is his beauty! &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The Lord alſo ſhall ſave the tents of</hi> Judah; <hi>Firſt, that the glory of the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and the glory of the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>do not magnifie themſelves againſt</hi> Judah; <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>in that day ſhall the Lord defend the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and he that is feeble among them at that time, ſhall be as</hi> David, <hi>and the Houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall he as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider the Teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Malachi, Chap.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiners fire, and fullers ſope, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which Text, let the words of that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> be obſerved, in his Sermon to the Lords, <hi>Aug.</hi> 27. 1645. which happily hath not been taken notice of by many, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. After diverſe things ſpoken to our purpoſe before, he adds, <hi>How ever the Scriptures teach us, that the Lord Jeſus will be revealed mightily, and will make bare his holy arm, as well in the confuſion of Antichriſt, as in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Jews, before the laſt judgement and the end of all things.</hi> Again, Page 5. he ſaith of this Text, this, <hi>I doubt not to aver, doth principally belong to the Jews, for to them pertain the promiſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>And the natural branches ſhall be grafted into their own Olive tree.</hi> I ſhall onely add here, that both terrible and comfortable Propheſie, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>Behold the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>But to you that fear my name, ſhall the ſun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ariſe, with healing in his wings, &amp;c.</hi> So that by all theſe evidences, we may ſee what exceeding great reaſon there

            <p>Again, as <hi>David</hi> was victorious at laſt over all enemies, and had peace round about; ſo will it be with Chriſts Kingdom in the world, over Satan and all his wicked dominion in the iſſue: And by the ſpirit of Propheſie King <hi>David</hi> hath declared much to this and the like effect in the book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and hence the following Prophets (as in the preceeding chapter may be obſerved) ſo often call Chriſt not onely the <hi>Branch, the off-ſpring of Jeſs, the Father of</hi> David, but oftner by <hi>Davids</hi> own name, and was foretold to ſit upon the throne of <hi>David,</hi> to be of the houſe, and over houſe of <hi>David,</hi> to build the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> and the like; ſo it is no wonder to have <hi>Davids</hi> heart full of ſuch matter, and his tongue in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect like the pen of a ready writter. And the breathings of the Spirit of God in <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms ſeem to vent themſelves much in ſuch delightful harmony concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt, who in all the former conſiderations, ſpiritually foreſaw him, not only as his Antitype and ſeed, but as the great Meſſiah and Saviour of him and his people, in whom both the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes both to him and the foreſathers ſhould both ſpiritually and temporally in due time have their full accompliſhment; And therefore if any perſons by the guidance of Scripture, and cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Texts, it may evidently appear to ſuch unprejudiced and ſerious teachable ſpirits, that a great part of the Pſalmody of holy <hi>David</hi> is warbled out according to ſuch celeſtial Ditties, as might magnifie and exalct Chriſt the Son of <hi>David;</hi> yet ſo as he might alſo appear to be the root of <hi>David,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5. even the eternal Son of God: and therefore ſo many expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are uſed in the Pſalms, which are incompetible to himſelf; or his meer natural ſeed.

            <p>That the 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> refers to Chriſts Kingdom, the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter declares, ſince he regains that ſoveraignty over the creatures which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, beſides the Apoſtles teſtimony <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. The 9. <hi>Pſalm</hi> contains much of the great works of God againſt his enemies, and for his people, which will be fulfilled at the ſetting up of Chriſts Kingdom. And ſo alſo Pſalm the 10. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the latter end; and the 11. Pſalm ſeems to be of the like nature. But in Pſal. 18. holy King <hi>David</hi> doth largely ſing of Chriſt under the type of his own Kingdom, but in ſuch a way as was not competible to it, ſaving in reference unto that King of Kings. And Pſal. 21. is very much of the ſame nature, but far exceeding what could be applied to <hi>Davids</hi> temporal Kingdom. The latter end of Pſalm 22. is remarkably of Chriſts Kingdom upon earth: And ſo likewiſe Pſalm 24. where the King of glory is to enter (as ſeems probable) the everlaſting doors of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> coming down from heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The 45. Pſalm is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently of Chriſts Kingdom, under the type of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and in part applied by the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8. And Pſalm 46. of the like nature; and ſo likewiſe the 48th. and alſo the firſt part of the 50th. and the latter part of the 53. The 67th. ſeems wholly to be prophetical of the time of Chriſts reign. But the 68. Pſal. contains much of the glory and grace of Chriſt then to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted. And the latter end of the 69th. is to the like purpoſe. Pſal. 72. Is a very glorious illuſtration of Chriſts Kingdom above what could be fulfilled either in <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> or any other but the Son of God, who ſhall be feared through all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in whoſe days righteouſneſs and peace ſhall flouriſh ſo long as the Moon endures, and ſhall rule to the ends of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102107:50"/>earth; and all Kings and Nations ſhall ſerve him, and his name ſhall continue for ever, and as long as the Sun endureth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The 80. Pſalm contains an excellent prayer for Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> to uſe, for the coming of the Meſſiah to take his Kingdom. In the 89th. ſuch promiſes are made to <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed, that could not be wholly fulfilled in any but Chriſt and his Kingdom. And the 96. is likewiſe prophetical of the Kingdom of Chriſt; and the 97. to the like purpoſe; and the 99. contains high expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Chriſts reign; and alſo the 102. The 110. Pſalm is an eminent prediction of Chriſts Kingdom, and applied often in the New Teſtament. The 132. evidently concerns the Kingdom of Chriſt. And not to inſiſt upon divers others, where there are notable expreſſions that ſeem to tend to the ſame purpoſe, take for a concluſion the 148, and the 149. which eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto Chriſts reign on earth, according to what in many former Scriptures and prophets have been foretold thereof; ſo from the beginning (almoſt) to the end we may obſerve how the Spirit of God ſtirred up the ſpirit of holy King <hi>David,</hi> to ſet forth the glory and excellent greatneſs of the kingdom of Chriſt, as his Antitype, ſeed and Saviour, in whom the greateſt promiſes of God ſhall be fulfilled, which could not have accompliſhment in any other.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102107:50"/>come onearth: yea, we might henceforth turn our argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a vehement expoſtulation with our ſelves: What? was not the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> the firſt Goſpeller we read of, at the time of his annunciation before our Saviours conception by the Holy Ghoſt, when he told the bleſſed Virgin of the holy, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, wonderful, heaven-bred Babe that ſhould ſhortly after that be born of her, an evident witneſs of Chriſts Kingdom to come? Or doth he to no purpoſe (after he had informed the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mother of our Lord of many unſpeakable glad tidings, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.30, 31. other ways) then after adds, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. <hi>And the Lord ſhall give him the throne of his Father</hi> David, <hi>and he ſhall reign over the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> Surely this holy Angel well underſtood the meaning of the many Prophets, yea of the Prophets of all ages before, as being contemporary with them all along from the beginning to that time. And did not that glad child <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> as one right bred of his beleeving mother <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon this good news leap for joy in his Mothers womb, when the Virgin came with it to her houſe; whereupon good <hi>Elizabeth</hi> told the Mother of our Lord, that aſſuredly there ſhould be a performance of thoſe things which were told her, <hi>Verſe</hi> 45. and was not this Kingdom of Chriſt one (if not the main) of them? And that bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin her ſelf in an holy rapture of Spirit, breaketh out in no leſs then the Angel had foreſhewed to her of this matter, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 54, 55. <hi>He hath holpen his ſervant</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in remembrance of his mercy, as he ſpake to our Fathers, to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed for ever,</hi> beleiving all in that Covenant would be performed, whereof the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inheritance and Chriſts Kingdom therein was part: And this again good <hi>Zachary</hi> (though upon occaſion of the Angels good news of his own ſon, which at firſt he beleeved not) he had been till then ſo dumb, that both the Mother and the Babe acknowledged Chriſt before him; yet when he had gotten the uſe of his ſpeech again, like a channel dammed up before, the living waters of the ſpirit ſoon run in a ſtronger current from his beleiving ſoul, then happily otherwiſe they would have done, and very much concerning the Kingdom of his Lord and Saviour, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 69. <hi>He hath raiſed up an born of ſalvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David,</hi> and this he confirmeth from the general ſucceſſive Teſtimony of the Prophets (which we in part ſet down in the two preceding Chapters, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 70. <hi>As he ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been ſince the world began,</hi>

                  </gap>.</hi> 71. he declares how general the redemption was by Chriſt, the mercy promiſed to the fathers, the covenant with them, the oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> (as we noted out of <hi>Moſes</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies) to free them from all enemies, and even from the fear of them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 74. which is the priviledge of Chriſts Kingdom on earth. Again, when the Angelimparted unto the Shepherds, when Chriſt was born, his very glad tidings of great joy to all people, he tells them firſt of that, that he was born in the City of <hi>David,</hi> who by deſcent was the Son of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh; where alſo the Prieſts informed <hi>Herod</hi> that he ſhould be born, when under pretence of worſhipping, he thought to deſtroy him (and thereupon made there many young Martyrs for him) yet upon that occaſion was found that great teſtimony of <hi>Micab</hi> Chap. 5.2. <hi>And thou</hi> Bethlehem <hi>in the land of</hi> Judah, <hi>art not the leaſt among the Princes of</hi> Judah: <hi>for out of thee ſhall come a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that ſhall rule my people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6. But the Angel tells the Shepherds, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.8. that he was of <hi>Davids</hi> houſe a Lord (as before <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6.) So in the regard of his preſent coming in the fleſh, he was born to them that day a Saviour, Chriſt: <hi>Moſhiach</hi> the Meſſiah implying likewiſe his threefold annointing, as Prophet, Prieſt, and King, and alſo for all people, Jews and and Gentles. So the Angel before, as this likewiſe now, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and declare him, the Chriſt, the Lord, the great Meſſiah, the great Ruler (though he was then a weak Babe in appearance, in mean outward condition in the worlds view, wrapped in ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cloths, having a Crath for a Cradle, a Manger for a Couch, being not received in the dwelling houſe, but lodged in a Stable, and that (O prodigy of abaſement!) at that time the moſt bleſſed Mother brought forth the moſt glorious infant King, her Son and Saviour (as was ſaid) of all people: Yet even then a multitude of the heavenly hoſt <hi>(Genethlia celebrant)</hi> and Carole loud and ſweetly the happineſs of his Nativity: <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Whereupon ſaid an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient aptly, <hi>Quis tam parvus, tam magnus, Infans jacens in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaepi voce Angelorum celebratus:</hi> What wonderful celeſtial Kingly glory in all that outward abaſement at his birth, is here by the eye of faith to be diſcerned; the glorious Angels are the Heraulds to publiſh his Kingly dignity over and over again, to ſet forth his Royal deſcent, yea, his Divine Majeſty, when he ſeemed only a deſpiſed weak new born babe; and others, and that a multitude too, ſing forth the high praiſes of his Nativity, the Holy Spirit
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102107:51"/>fills the hearts of old and young, great and ſmall, poor and rich, men and women with joy, and inlarged Diſcourſes of his Kingly excellence, before and about his birth. The Star and the Sages ſoon after, with ſpeedy courſe, come out of the Eaſt, to give this much more glorious day ſtar, yea, Sun of righteouſneſs, a timely viſit: And to tender that glorious object to the unbelieving world, that they might take a view with them of that King and Saviour, even then new born to Gods faithful people, and after their example worſhip him, and bring their offerings to him. And they make inquiry of the place of this new Kings birth, <hi>Where is he that is born King of the Jews?</hi> and ſuch was their zeal towards him, that no outward meanneſs hinders them from yeilding him all due homage and obſervance of worſhip, with oblations of gold, frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, and myrrhe.</p>
            <p>Thns God in his weakeſt eſtate of life in the world, would have all ſorts in heaven and in earth aſſiſt in ſome meet Equipage ſuitable to his Kingly Dignity.

Old <hi>Anna</hi> in publique declares the like to all that look for redemption in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there it was in ſome reſpect too well known, temporal redemption was expected as well as ſpiritual, though they did it unſeaſonably, for which they had ſufficient Scripture ground, though then miſapplyed by them. And though it was common amongſt the Jews in thoſe times to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102107:52"/>neglect the ſpiritual redemption by Chriſt, and vainly ſeek to anticipate the temporal, then long after to come by their great King the Meſſiah; yet even then that true <hi>Iſraelite Nathaniel</hi> had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better concerning Chriſt, and made confeſſion thereof unto him of both: <hi>Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>John</hi> 1.49.</p>
            <p>The mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children acknowledged no leſs, though unwarrantably applyed, when ſhe would have her two Sons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, <hi>The one at his right hand, and the other at his left in his kingdom,</hi> Mat. 20.21.

            <p>Chriſt being the King of the Jews was ſuch a noted thing, that when he was to dye, it was mentioned either in ſcorn or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, or atteſted by God and Men, and Chriſt himſelf at every turn after he came before <hi>Pilate</hi> (the chief Prieſts and Elders having examined him about deſtroying the Temple, and his being the Son of God) but the main accuſation againſt him, was his being a King, which he never denied: though they falſly added, he thereupon forbad to pay tribute unto <hi>Ceſar:</hi> yet in that wherein the ſtrength of the temptation lay, he fairly reſolved <hi>Pilate,</hi> that his Kingdom was not from hence, or of this world (his Kingdom will be from God and not from men) but beſides that, as oſt as <hi>Pilate</hi> mentioned him to be the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and asked him if he were ſo, he never denied it: Yea, when the

            <p>Yet at laſt by that poyſoned dart (I ſay) they would ſtrike home; <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not</hi> Ceſars <hi>friend; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever makes himſelf a King ſpeakethagainſt</hi> Ceſar: and yet after that he bad them <hi>Behold their King,</hi> and when they cryed <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> He urges, <hi>Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> And when he was enforced ſtill upon his Loyalty to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and to avoid tumult, having waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hands as guiltleſs of Chriſts blood, and the Jews taking it upon themſelves and their children, he delivered him to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Pilate</hi> is over-ruled by God to write his Title in Greek, and Latine, and Hebrew, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.36. <hi>[This is the King of the Jews</hi>] as if the ſucceſſions of the Greek, Latine, and Heorew Churches, in order might read and acknowledge it till he took his Kingdom: And when the Jews envied this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And after that, above all (not to inſiſt upon many other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages) take notice here of that wonderful Confeſſor, if not firſt Martyr of, and with Chriſt, the formerly infamous, but ſince famous good thief, that when the world ſought to caſt the greateſt ignominy and contempt upon Chriſt, he moſt of all to their faces, ſet forth his honour, and even then by putting forth his right hand of a true faith upon the Croſs, to lay hold upon his laſt and beſt booty, to ſteal unexpectedly the Kingdom of Heaven, condemnes then both himſelf and his fellow-thief, and the wicked world which condemned and crucified our Saviour and King, in the loweſt dejection of his preſent condition, acknowledging then Chriſts Soveraignty and right to his Kingdom, and power to give it to others, yea, even to himſelf, when he was ſo vile and miſerable in other reſpects, ſaying <hi>[Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom</hi> happily, he had been before a well principled <hi>Jew,</hi> but had for a time with-held the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, but now (by grace) ſuch good education breaketh forth with light of truth and comfort in him, and he looks for no leſs then a Kingdom at the hands of a crucified Saviour and Soveraign; here was a glory above the wonted brightneſs of the Sun, when the Sun himſelf for ſhame hid his face in darkneſs, from the then darkned and ſpiritually hardened world; Thus the Kingly glory of Chriſt was (even then) ſo held out by the Spirit of power to the ſaith of Gods people, ſo that from the firſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of Chriſt at his birth, and even conception too, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the very hour of his death, his Kingly excellency was ſtrongly atteſted by all ſorts of Angels, and men, young and old, high and low, good and bad, Creatour, and creatures, in Heaven and Earth, the ſtar at his birth, the ſun at his death, the Rocks, the Earth, the Vale of the Temple, the dead Saints that ſlept and roſe again, and went into the holy City, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> enemies and friends; what evidence in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects could be more glorious in ſuch an ebbe of ſeeming dejection

            <p>Thus having offered unto the conſideration of ſerious and truly Chriſtian Spirits, all the forementioned evidences to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this glorious, excellent truth (wherein the main difficulty of the matter ſeemed to lye) as reſpecting the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, thoſe things fore-promiſed to be enjoyed by.

            <p>And alſo temporally, <hi>viz.</hi> abundance of outward plenty, peace, ſecurity, comfort, in the enjoyment of the temporal bleſſings and good things of this life, more then ever any ages of the world, ſince the fall obtained, whereunto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures likewiſe give large Teſtimony. But becauſe there have been in ſundry Proofs already many things ſet forth to this purpoſe, concerning the things of Chriſts Kingdom, and in the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>We ſhould likewiſe (in the laſt place) adde ſome improvement of this to all ſorts of perſons, which we ſhall only at preſent in two words (as it were) adjoyn: Firſt, to warn all oppoſers to take heed that either by denying or oppoſing Chriſt Kingdome in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102107:54"/>Doctrine, practice, or project, leaſt when Chriſt comes in his Kingdom they ſhould be found reſiſters thereof, and fighters againſt it; or particularly comes in wrath againſt any ſuch in the interim, by ſending any ſwift meſſenger thereof unto them: remembring his ſentence againſt thoſe old rebels the Jews, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. <hi>But thoſe mine enemes, that would not that I ſhould rule over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> For it is a deſperate danger to be found fighters againſt Chriſt upon any account, or engagement in the world whatſoever; at any other time, but more eſpecially at that time when he ſhall come in his glory, and will manifeſt his great power and wrath upon them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To encourage all Chriſts over-comers to be valiant and reſolute in fighting againſt and reſiſting of, all Satanical frauds, and Antichriſtian oppoſitions againſt Chriſt and his Kingdom, and to plead Chriſts right for the ſtrenghening of others to ſtand on Chriſts part (but always according to Chriſts warrant and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) in the pleading of this his laſt clauſe in the laſt part of his New Teſtament-will left amongſt us, in ſpecial mercy to poor unworthy ſinners. And for their encouragement they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from his word, that it ſeems not to be long before he will make it good: Surely (ſaith he) <hi>I come quickly,</hi> Rev. 22.20. and this is according to the order of things therewith deſcribed, probable in its order to draw on very faſt: For Antichriſts ruin will make way for Chriſts reign on earth, in that his eminent Kingdome, Office, and Authority; and to that end, let both ſorts ſeriouſly conſider, that excellent cloſure of the Propheſie of that Evangelical Prophet <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> the laſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which ſeems very appoſite to that purpoſe, and ſeriouſly to be weighed upon ſundry conſiderations, both reſpecting the latter time; of Anti-chriſt, and divers matters concerning Chriſts Kingdom then to come: And ſo we conclude with the Churches earneſt requeſt unto Chriſt for the haſtening of his coming. Even ſo come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, Amen.</p>

By way of Antitheſis to the laſt more general reſurrection, of the good and bad before not raiſed, is of great concernment to the then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving godly, and Saints departed before; let us confider what the Scriptures ſet before us concerning the ſame; And becauſe Chriſt hath more fully revealed to his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. the pleaſure of his father therein, more then formerly was made known in the word (for the Doctrine of the reſurrection in diverſe things in the Old and New Teſtament, was revealed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews ſome myſteries of it, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour there more.) Let us therefore in the firſt place conſider the context of what is there ſaid thereof, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. and then come to the verſes wherein it is contained.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. <hi>He ſhuts him up in the bottomleſs pit, and ſeals, or ſecures him there during that time, but ſhews he muſt after the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years be looſed for a little ſeaſon.</hi> And the fulfilling of that his looſing is ſet down (as this <hi>matutina,</hi> or firſt reſurrection is decyphered, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6.)</p>
            <p>For <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Shews when Satan is accordingly looſed out of Priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. Shews how he prevails to gather his hoſts of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> in great numbers, in all the four quarters of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. Sets down their deſign to compaſs the camp of the Saints, and their diſappointment, by fire from heaven, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. Shews the judgement of Satan, <hi>in the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and falſe Prophet were caſt before the thouſand years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. And ſo forward to the end, is deſcribed the enſuing laſt judgement, where the judge is ſet down in this 11. <hi>verſe,</hi> and his Throne he ſat on; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. the perſons judged, all ſorts, ſmall and great, the ways of their tryal, by opening the books, and according to their works.</p>

               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14, 15. Shews who were caſt into the lake of fire at the laſt, namely, <hi>Death the laſt enemy,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>and Hell, or the grave, with all whoſe names were not written in the Book of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning this firſt reſurrection, it is largely deſcribed in many particulars, <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. In the firſt place are thrones; and they that ſate on them, and judgement was given unto them; which ſeems to be ſuch eminent holy perſons, as the Apoſtles or great Prophets, aſſeſſors with Chriſt then, that as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour promiſed ſhould ſit and judge on thrones at his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29, 30. Secondly; All other faithful Saints
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102107:59"/>that lived and reigned with Chriſt the thouſand years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. declares the different conditions of all others, there called the reſt of the dead, that had not part in that firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. Contains the condition, quality, and priviledges of all the then raiſed Saints; Firſt, they are bleſſed; Secondly, they are holy, and therefore bleſſed; Thirdly, They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſecured; the ſecond death ſhall have no power on them; they are moſt ſafe from the judgement of the wicked that will come. Fourthly, the excellency of their promotion; Firſt, to be Prieſts of God and Chriſt, to offer praiſe, &amp;c. continually. Secondly, Kings to reign with him the thouſand years.</p>
            <p>And this the Parallel Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. and ſo forward, at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, doth likewiſe confirm, where, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. is ſet down the beginning of Chriſts reign upon earth, and the continuance for ever, while the earth continues. Secondly, the praiſe of the Church thereupon, namely, the twenty four elders, now without mention of the four beaſts, (as formerly) <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. There is the object of their praiſe, Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, which is, and was, and is to come, and then reigned. Secondly, The ground of that their prayſing him for taking his great power and reigning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. The occaſion, opportunity, and advantage, that Chriſt took then to take his great power, and to reign. Firſt, of evil unto the evil; the Nations were provoked to anger and rage by the Devil, againſt the Saints (as alſo he will do to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Camp of the Saints, when Satan is looſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.9.) and here Gods wrath came upon them, in devouring fire, and deſtroyed them that deſtroyed the earth in the end of the 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> Secondly, in the middle part of the ſame verſe, we have the advantage or opportunity Chriſt takes of good to the good. Firſt, of the dead before that; They ſhould then be raiſed; and they are of two degrees; Firſt, Gods eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets, that ſhould have ſuitable reward to their great ſervice or ſufferings, or both; And Secondly, leſs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints. Again, good to the good, then alive on earth, ſuch as fear Gods name, ſmall and great; for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and holy dead raiſed then will be above ſear; there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love (as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks) hath caſt out fear.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:102107:60"/>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. There is deſcribed the ſpiritual glory of the grace of God, diſcovered in Chriſt above what was before, ſo as peculiar to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that comes down from heaven. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God was opened in heaven, and there was ſeen in his temple the Ark of his Teſtament; and on the other hand, is ſet forth the terrour of Gods wrath, manifeſt then againſt ungodly men, to be horribly deſtroyed from the earth, as is ſet down at this time,
<note place="margin">So Pſal. 50 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. which likewiſe referres both to the good and the wicked.</p>
            <p>Now for the condition or ſtate of the raiſed Saints, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be like, or ſuitable to what was in Chriſt before he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Father, that appeared and diſappeared as he ſaw good for his Diſciples, and ſometime eat and drank with them, as both the Goſpel manifeſts,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Mat. 26.29. compared with Luk. 22.18, 19. one verſe ſpeak of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the other of the Lords Supper.</note> and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.41. But not ſo glorious as will be after in the higheſt heavens, which the Saints on earth could not abide, as being too great for mortal eys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in that ſtate our Saviour is recorded to have ſpoken to them in the 40. days after he aroſe from the dead, concerning this Kingdom of God we ſpeak of, as is likely <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. which might occaſion the Diſciples asking <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. whether at this time he would reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And he alſo might then promiſe to them the New Heavens, and the New Earth, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome make great ſtir againſt the manifeſt drift and ſcope of <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. becauſe the ſouls are ſaid to live; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that in Scripture, <hi>Idem,</hi> ſouls are taken for perſons fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How fitly may that be reſolved by conſidering them viſſionally, in the ſtate they were repreſented to Saint <hi>John</hi> then, and were to be in, when they were to have their bodies quickned, which is plainly the drift of that Revelation in that text<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>! for it had been no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to have ſaid their ſouls only lived, nor that their ſouls thence ſhould raign, unleſs in a ſtate ſutable to Chriſt with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to be with them on earth. And the like Decypher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the deceaſed Saints were then alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.13, 14. where they are ſaid to be <hi>arrayed in white robes,</hi> &amp;c. Namely, as they ſhall be when they ſhall be raiſed and raign with Chriſt on earth; and ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.11. <hi>White r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bes were given to every one of them,</hi> which is ſpoken of the ſame ſouls, but then repreſented unto him in viſion, in what manner thoſe ſouls will appear, when their bodies ſhall be raiſed at Chriſts Kingdom.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:102107:60"/>
            <p>And this is further evident from the Anticheſis of them that lived not again then; namely, in reſpect of their bodies, ſo that theſe muſt then live again in reſpect of their bodies. Thirdly, They muſt live again in that reſpect they were before dead, that is, of their bodies, for their ſouls always lived; only their bodies were dead; therefore thoſe, and only thoſe, then lived again. Fourthly, They muſt then ſo live, as will be moſt ſuitable to Chriſts ſtate of reigning on earth, as being their head, who is therefore the firſt fruits of the reſurrection; he eminently ſhewed his power and pleaſure in this at his very death, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludium what he would do when he came to raign more generally for the Saints, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. when many dead Saints aroſe and went into the holy City; when Chriſt for a time after his reſurrection was in ſuch a middle condition in regard of his body; and who would have thought of ſuch a thing to be done then, if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not ſo clearly recorded it. So that as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid before King <hi>Agrippa, Act.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</hi> So why that then he will ſo raiſe them, when his word fully teſtifies it ſormerly more and more clearly, and at laſt moſt clearly; therefore (ſaith he) when the Son of Man ſhall come (namely, at that coming we ſpeak of) ſhall he find faith on the earth. This was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied by <hi>Zach. chap.</hi> 14.5. typified in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as buried in the Red-ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. alluded to in this particular caſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. beſides the places ſpoken of above.</p>
            <p>Again, on the other ſide, that thoſe ſouls living (or as is ſaid of the other ſort <hi>v.</hi> 6.) living again, is not to be underſtood Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, lay together all the enſuing conſiderations. Firſt, It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Propheſie, for they always ſo lived ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of this life. Secondly, To underſtand it ſpiritually was no new Revelation, for that was a plain known truth, ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and acknowledged in the Church of God. Thirdly, The (living) there is not of the ſouls ſpiritually, becauſe this is of a (living) peculiar to that time, not to be before nor after, but at the laſt more general reſurrection. Fourthly, Becauſe they can only in a particular manner to that time only live, in ſuch ſence as they could before be ſaid to be dead; not ſpiritually but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bodily. Fifthly, They cannot ſpiritually be ſaid to raign with Chriſt that thouſand years, in ſuch a ſpiritual manner as the Text imports; becauſe, ſpiritually they did ſo before. Sixthly, They are not ſuitable to the outward glory of Chriſts Kingdom in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102107:61"/>world then, if they have not their bodies. Seventhly, Many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar promiſes to the Fathers and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> imply it muſt be bodily, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>piritual only. Eightly, (as we before hinted) the ſpiritual raign without the bodily will not be ſuitable to the ſtate, nature, and end of Chriſts Kingdom; for then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his prayer, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory;</hi> not only ſpiritually but bodily, wherein that viſion will much conſiſt. Again, adde, as he is the firſt fruits of the reſurrection, in regard of body, not ſoul, ſo they in reſpect of their bodies will be a great part of the harveſt hallowed by that firſt fruits.</p>
            <p>Again, conſider the Doctrine of the reſurrection, as we hinted before, hath been ſet forth by degrees; it was but rarely and darkly taught in the Old Teſtament; hence our Saviour to confute the <hi>Sadduces</hi> out of <hi>Moſes</hi> (who would be his Diſciples in preſence) by an inference, repells their errour, not by plain words: God is the God of the living, not of the dead; but he is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> therefore they live; and little we find but <hi>Jobs</hi> profeſſion of his own faith, and the promiſe to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Eſays</hi> myſtical propheſie <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. and ſome few miraculouſly raiſed by the Divine power of Chriſt, as types of that to come, which the moſt of them (if not all) ſeem to have reference unto this very time of Chriſts beginning to raign (as we ſhall endeavour by and by to make evident) and for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the New Teſtament, he ſets forth many things concerning the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, after he had 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. in the beginning of the <hi>Chapter</hi> ſtrongly proved it againſt that Sadducaical opinion; eſpecially, by the reſemblances betwixt the firſt <hi>Adane</hi> and the ſecond, and by the dying and quickening of grain, which was our Saviours own reſemblance for his own death, <hi>Except a Corn of Wheat he caſt into the earth,</hi> &amp;c. So when the Apoſtle in the ſaid <hi>Chapter</hi> goes on to ſpeak of the Doctrine thereof, he ſets forth many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it; the ground or cauſe, Chriſt the firſt fruits; the order firſt,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 23, 24, 25, 26.</note> thoſe that are Chriſts at his coming, namely, this coming when only the Saints will be raiſed; then ſhews what will be before the end; namely, all rule, all authority of the evil world, muſt be ſubdued by Chriſt; and even the laſt enemy to be ſubdued will be death; and then ſhews a myſtery afterward about that point; yea, many myſteries, as follow largely <hi>Verſ.</hi> 51, 52, 53, 54. having in the middle of the <hi>Chapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, The time, when the Saints in a ſpecial manner alone ſhould be ſo raiſed by him; namely, at this his coming, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Thirdly, He gives an intimation how long he muſt reign after that coming, till all enemies be put under his feet. Fourthly, He ſets down the laſt enemy to be ſubdued, that is, death, which came by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and at laſt ſhall be deſtroyed by the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Fifthly, In <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. is imployed his invincible prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when all enemies are deſtroyed; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. how as Man or Mediatour Chriſt will be ſubject to the Father to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. gives a clear evidence, which is concerning the raign of Chriſt on earth; after which <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews as Mediatour he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers up the Kingdom to God the Father, <hi>verſ</hi> 24. <hi>When death and hell ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> as was ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. read what will then be at the laſt moſt general reſurrection hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 51, 52, 53, 54. Conſider the many particulars there taught in this point not known uſually before, and ſo in like manner in the 20. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Chriſt reveals to Saint <hi>John</hi> more fully and clearly what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had taught before obſcurely and darkly, till hereby explained; namely, that under the ſeventh Trumpet, when Chriſt ſhall come to raign on earth, and ſhew himſelf there gloriouſly in his Kingly Office, there ſhall be ſuch a firſt reſurrection of Martyrs, Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſuch holy perſons of all ſorts, as was obſerved before; and this Gods faithful people ought to know and believe, to their great comfort and rejoycing, as well as any thing concerning the Doctrine of the reſurrection ſo gradually made known to the Church before, as Chriſt was pleaſed any way before to diſpence the knowledge thereof to the glory of him who ſhall ſo raiſe them to raing with him here, where they have ſerved him in faithfulneſs, or ſuffered for him, or with him.</p>
            <p>And now we ſhall by Gods gracious aſſiſtance proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider other Scriptures, that ſeem to confirm this which we have delivered from Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. And this doubtleſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the holy Fathers and Prophets in the Old Teſtament, concerning the raiſing of the deceaſed Saints at Chriſts Kingdom on earth, as really, though not ſo clearly, as it is now to us in the New Teſtament, as being the cheif glory of that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wherein they were to have their part; therefore, God is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that ſhould be his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial for ever; to whom, and their poſterities with them, the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102107:62"/>land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was promiſed and ſhadowed out, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhed at this time fully, wherein all the great promiſes to that purpoſe are to have their compeat accompliſhment, <hi>vid.</hi> Deut. 30, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.20, 21. <hi>Eze.</hi> 37.25. This <hi>Jobs</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation had particularly reſpect unto, <hi>When the Judge ſhould ſtand on the earth at the laſt day</hi> (as the original carries it) and <hi>Daniel</hi> was to ſtand in the lot at this time (as before we ſhewed) and which ſeems to be our Saviours drift in the Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. and for this end the great promiſes of circumciſing the heart of the ſeed of thoſe holy Fathers tend to this, <hi>Deut</hi> 30.6. when they had been driven to the utmoſt parts of heaven, and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lands which their Fathers poſſeſſed, that they might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.5.6. in their ſight. So that Evangeligal Prophet <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> 26. profeſſeth of himſelf, and the faithful with him, in that his excellent Song to this purpoſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. where having ſpoken in order of the condition of Gods people in the time now paſt, unto the time of the reſurrection of Gods people at this very period (as may appear from the Context) for having ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of their condition in the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>When other Lords beſides the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>had had Deminion over them, and yet they would by him only make mention of his name.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe Lords (he ſaith) <hi>They are dead, they ſhall not live; they are deceaſed, they ſhall not riſe; therefore, he had viſited, and deſtroyed them, and made all their memory to periſh,</hi> verſ. 14. though they themſelves were removed, that were his Nation, into all the ends of the earth, and though a long time after they had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and been like a woman with child in pangs and hopes, yet had brought forth nothing but wind, ſince for long time there was no deliverance wrought in the earth, neither did the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of fall, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. yet that both would come to paſs he profeſſeth his ſaith, ſaying of Gods people and of himſelf: Thy dead men ſhall live together, with my dead body ſhall they ariſe; awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt [as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and riſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life,</hi> as alſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 60.1.] and then it followeth, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead; where he fully ſhews his faith concerning this firſt reſurrection, where he ſhews the Jews ſhould be a herbs after winter is paſt, quickened by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving dew of the ſpring-time; whereas the Lords ſpoken of <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. were ſuch as are mentioned not then to riſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20, 5. the inhabitants that had not fallen till that time thoſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102107:62"/>to the end, but the Jews Church and himſelf, as at the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when thoſe ſaid inhabitants of the earth, among the reſt of the dead that lived not, ſhould have no part in that firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when unto himſelf and Gods people, both a temporal and ſpiritual reſurrection will be both of body and ſoul, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition at that time; hence the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> as two ſticks joyned into one, though like dead bones before ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet then God ſhews they ſhould be raiſed with fleſh and skin; and be and ſtand up as a great army, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. [and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be referred the myſtical reſurrection of the two ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth witneſſes as typical thereof.] And this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to declare by the Allegory of the two Teſtaments, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. reſembled by <hi>Hagar,</hi> which was Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> that gendred to bondage; and <hi>Sarah</hi> the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above, that is the Mother of all the faithful; that Mother City prepared for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. that will then come down from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City of the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. with all her children, <hi>The children of the reſurrection,</hi> as our Saviour ſtiles the faithful, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.36. ſhall poſſeſs, unto which purpoſe he applyes Gods being the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. next following; yea, moreover our Saviour deſcribs the faithful, <hi>v.</hi> 35. by being counted worthy to receive that world, and the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead; obſerve the expreſſions; ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of a world to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed hither with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. as appears from the context. And <hi>Act.</hi> 2.29, 30. the Apoſtle applies the promiſe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triark <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 130.11. of his Seeds ſitting upon his throne to Chriſts reſurrection, who is the reſurrection, and life to all that are his, which then will be fulfilled; and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.16. his ſeed is ſaid to be eſtabliſhed before him. And as for ſuch as were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully raiſed from the dead in the Old and New Teſtament, being all raiſed by the power of Chriſt, and by the vertue of his reſurrection, in its time to be accompliſhed, were to ſtrengthen the faith of Gods people in all times, following that Chriſt in his due time which now is revealed, would raiſe up from the dead all his believing Saints and faithful ſervants. Yea, that eminent manifeſtation of Chriſts kingly glory, before his three diſciples at his transfiguration, having <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> then ſo talking with him of his deceaſe, which he was ſhortly after to accompliſh at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeems remarkably to ſet before us that we now ſpeak of, namely, that when he will appear in the world to be the great
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102107:63"/>King of his people on earth the ſaid thouſand years, that then ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall appear with him, and be greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an obſervation of godly and learned men upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made in the Epiſtles to the ſeven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, that ſome of them ſignifie the ſtate of the Church in the Primitive times, as it were adumbrated and reſembled in the two firſt Epiſtles; in the five laſt the times of Antichriſts date of 42. months; but all the promiſes in thoſe ſeven Epiſtles relate to the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> As firſt, as our Saviour told his Diſciples that followed him, that in the regeneration, they ſhould ſit on Thrones, judging the 12. Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> anſwerable to that promiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He will grant to him that overcometh to ſit with him on his Throne, even as he alſo overcame and was ſet down with his father in his Throne;</hi> and that will be fulfilled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Chriſt hath made them Kings and Prieſts unto God and his Father,</hi> who is himſelf there ſtilled the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: So in Chriſts kingdom upon earth that will be fulfilled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Saints ſhall be Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</hi> So that promiſe <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.7. where promiſe is made, <hi>To him that overcometh to eat of the Tree of Life, in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God,</hi> by alluſion to the tree in Paradiſe, whereby eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life ſhould have been confirmed to <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had ſtood, that is applyed to ſuch as ſhall have their part in the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> Chap. 22.14. <hi>who ſhall have right to the tree of life:</hi> ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4, 5. promiſe is made <hi>to walk with Chriſt in white, and white raiment.</hi> So ſuch as ſhall come into the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> Rev. 7.9, 13. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.8. Chriſts armies that followed him, <hi>were cloathod in fine linnen, white and clean.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. promiſe is made <hi>to be a pillar in the houſe of God, and go no more out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to have the name of God written on them,</hi> &amp;c. Anſwerably again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.3, 4. <hi>His ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their fore-heads.</hi> Again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.11. <hi>They ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death.</hi> Anſwerable to that <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.6. <hi>On ſuch the ſecond death ſhall have no power.</hi> So it is promiſed to ſuch, <hi>Their name ſhall not be blotted out of the Book of Life, but be confeſſed before the Father, and before his Angels,</hi> Rev. 3.5. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.27. <hi>They enter the</hi> New Jeruſalem <hi>whoſe names are written in the Book of life.</hi> All which, and divers other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Saints, to whom all along from Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time, theſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102107:63"/>promiſes have been made, they cannot have fulfilled to them in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> upon earth in Chriſt raign, if they be not raiſed then from the dead. And that promiſe <hi>Of raiſing ſuch up at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 6. <hi>To ſuch as his Father hath given him,</hi> verſ. 39. <hi>To ſuch as ſee the Son, and believe on him,</hi> verſ. 40. <hi>To ſuch as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draweth to come to him,</hi> verſ. 44. <hi>To ſuch as eat his fleſh, and drink his blood,</hi> v. 54. four times repeated in that latter part of that <hi>Chap.</hi> is manifeſt to be under ſtood of that firſt <hi>matutina reſurrectio,</hi> called the laſt day in reſpect of the world, at the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the finiſhing together of that age, while evil men are mixed with good, like tares in the field; when as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. the world time ſhall be no more, when he will raiſe all his people that then ſleep in the grave, to raign on earth with him, till the great multitude of their fellow-members be come in.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine many of the ancient Fathers acknowledged in the firſt Primative times, as <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> reckoned by Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew, Irenaeus</hi> in his 5. Book and 5. laſt Chap. <hi>Nepos</hi> B. of <hi>Egypt, Tertullian</hi> in his 3. book againſt <hi>Marcion, Lactanti.</hi> in his 7. book of Inſtit. chap. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſometime held it, though by the ſubtilty of Satan, forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lyes to aſperſe the Millenary opinion, and ſtirring men up to foyſt in offenſive errours in thoſe times, both Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others laid it down after him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Chriſt in theſe latter times hath again diſcovered it, after ſo many hundred years of its lying hid for the moſt part in the Church, to be a doctrine really to be imbraced by his faithful people, who ſhall have the good of it, and wherein he will appear wonderful, in and toward his Saints in the ſaid Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Again, it is obſervable in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, and 4. Chapters, after he had ſpoken of that reſt of the people of <hi>Iſraels</hi> entring into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of Gods reſt from the work of Creation, and Chriſts reſting from the work of Redemption, he ſpeaks of an other reſt from <hi>Davids</hi> words; <hi>To day, after ſo long a time, it is ſaid to day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> &amp;c. and then concludes, there remains a reſt or Sabbatiſme for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, which they ſhould have in this world, and that ſeems to be in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> then living, or raiſed from the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that Text, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Many that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake,</hi> here take notice, it is ſaid (many) not all ſhall awake, <hi>ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102107:64"/>and everlaſting contempt;</hi> may be anſwered one of theſe three ways, either as an abridgement of both reſurrections, the <hi>matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> and <hi>veſpertina,</hi> as he ſometimes ſpeaks in breif of things far diſtant, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. one of the Primitive times, the other of the end of Antichriſts time; or elſe of the reſurrection after Chriſts reign on earth only, at the laſt judgment, which will then be general, both of quick and dead, good and bad. But thirdly I conceive, the beſt anſwer is according to the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt analogie of the two Prophets <hi>Ezekiels</hi> and <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſies, and reality of the matter of which they both ſpeak, that it is to be underſtood of both the civil and ſpiritual reſurrection of the twelve tribes, that in appearance had long lain like dead bones, <hi>Eze.</hi> 37. but according to both Propheſies, ſhould then be as raiſed from the dead; of which at firſt there will be ſome of two ſorts (as we formerly noted) ſome continuing to ſhine gloriouſly by their perſeverance; others falling to ſhame and contempt, by therievoltings, about that time of the <hi>matutina reſurrectio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for improvement, only theſe two hints.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How ſhould the conſideration of this Doctrine comfort Chriſts faithful Saints and Servants againſt all worldly diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they may for his cauſe hereafter meet with in any kind? for even in reſpect of this recompence here ſet before them, which they ſhall enjoy in this world the ſaid thouſand years; all their ſufferings will not be to be compared to that glory, which will then be revealed and enjoyed, over and above that which will after be added and perpetuated unto them to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How ſhould it quicken and incite them diligently to endeavour to live to him here, with whom they have ſo abundant evidence, that they ſhall live and reign hereafter?</p>
            <p>Yea, and not only to incite them to dye with him too, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for him (if he require it) as is ſtoried of Chriſtians in the Primitive times, who from their ſtrength of faith, as reſpecting this Doctrine, were deſirous of Martyrdom; that as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. <hi>they might obtain a better reſurrection, even to have their part in this reſurrection of the juſt,</hi> whereby will be further moſt certainly ſecured to them, <hi>That on them the ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ond death ſhall have no power,</hi> Rev. 20.6. but being perfectly holy, they thenceforth perfectly happy will doubtleſs certainly know, that upon their rapture to meet Chriſt, they ſhall be perfected in glory for evermore in heaven.</p>
